Promised Land	People have been smoking cigarettes for years, and it is only relatively recently that the link between smoking tobacco and  cancer has been publicly acknowledged.  Imagine if we had put some serious impartial research into the dangers of cigarettes in 1912 when American Dr. Isaac Adler made the link between lung cancer and tobacco, many lives would have potentially been saved.

"too many people standing their ground...standing the wrong ground"! {john trudell..."crazy horse"} please have a listen and roperly situate oneself! You forgot green zone moi! hmmm~~~"hardened gas man" genius goodwill bourne hereafter t.a.b. and what native natural position for whose north american continent?~~~~~~~~~ i could indicate more yet most likely just many of the damned catching up with the truth! It must be something(chinatown) in the Colorado water. Lol?! This Trailer is Great Movie. No, #really, wrote on from multiple media arising interests. So I checked it out here, first. And hog wallowed the crazy off comments. Personally, disenchanted easily, but has some draw! Hard to say 'no'; straight down to earth current vernacular news current issues hoopla agenda. Bound for political awareness and action to remedy. XD. Freaking Fracing did start in the 1940's when the One world island Pangea Combusted from earth quake and CHANGEd Melting from unknown science; and Movies where evolving from the historical American Musical into the TVpipeline...! whats the opening instrumental song? But you would rather see american children die from drinking contaminated water? You make no sense you liberal piece of trash!! There is only one place in the world where fracking hurts, and thats because of the unique geological features of it.  Wow, nice comment. Let me ask you, about opec. Are those countries in good shape? Is saudi arabia in any kind of shape? Because of asshats like you, who won't let you drill you're own damn land their eight year old little girls get raped and murdered over western oil. "Well that's not true at all" Shut up, it is.  I've seen horrible things happen in those countries because of us and eu oil contracts. Hell this fifteen year iraq war is because of those godamn resource treaties.  Hmmm... double hmmmm...I'm pretty sure we all see the 'twist' coming, without it there is no point in watching the movie.Dov S 'Greatest film educator in the whole world' Simmons put it this way: "In any movie, you know the outcome in the first 10 minutes, if you don't you ain't watching the movie. Once established it is the film-makers job to make you doubt that outcome"Based on this trailer, I really wanna see it because I want to believe that a hardened gas-man has a heart and can change. Of Monsters and Men in the soundtrack means instant win! :DWell, not necessarily, but it's cool to hear... So, you liked it? ;) True, but in point of fact, the method currently utilized was pioneered in the 1990s. This was one of the most ponderous pieces of agitprop I have ever had the misfortune to endure. Recently, I've seen two movies that were over three hours long and combined they felt shorter than this dismal dog turd. Imagine the most boring, interminable sermon you have ever witnessed and you'll have a good idea what this film felt like. And the plot "twist" is a classic example of telegraphing the pass. Only audience members with the IQ of plankton won't see it coming. You work for them, that's why. You will burn in hell no matter if you want to deny you are destroying the earth and hurting people or not. God can read your mind and subconscious, you cannot hide your atrocities from him.
A Quiet Day in Belfast	were can i get copie of this film What the actual fuck! awful stereotypical nonsense with bad NI accents...
Act of Vengeance	who is doing the narration? sounds like charles aidman. Trailer gave it little justice, besides the acting being a tad lame. It was really a good movie. Not at brutal as I spit on your grave, but then again, not much is. Feminists are needing to see this film That was an amazing karate kick. Which in a real fight  would have knocked out your opponent. You can find it for sale at certain places online....Hint!  it's streaming on netflix Wouldn't it be better if you will let us see the whole movie? we're not gonna find a movie from the 1970's in a video rent Haha rape squad RATED R!!! Of course you loved it. Cause I'm the BEST! Charlie's Angels VS Jason He join in going 'girl look at dat body, girl look at dat body.  Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle'  XD I hate Xmas!  If she'd sang "I'm sexy and I know it" the guy would've left her alone and started dancing instead. Just Sing JINGLE BELLS! dude thanks for the trailer! i recently picked up the US HBO clam VHS of this and now Im really psyched to watch it lol. I definitely saw this in the U.K. under it's "The Violator" title in 1976/1977 but is this the film where he whistles or sings "Jingle Bells" during one of his attacks? I'm sure I've seen a trailer for Abel Ferra's Angel of Vengeance/Ms45 under the title Rape Squad. Think it was either on an old Aussie Cannibal Apocalypse or Zombie Creeping Flesh VHS @jamessmedley82 I have to agree with you. Women that are that gorgeous when they're younger, stay that gorgeous. She was uber fine then and I'll bet she still is! I'd love to see what she looks like today. There just isn't that much out there, that I can find? cheesy @IAMSATAN8 Can definitely tell you have seen this movie.  Yes, great watching!
Reflections of Murder 	strange film x pretty good movie . I like the remake with Melissa Gilbert Good movie...thanks for posting. Didn't anyone here see "Les Diaboliques"? RIP Joan Hackett. I want to shake her and say WAKE THE FUCK UP YOU DUMBASS! Gah, this woman on here is a freaking IDIOT!!!! This is simply a wretched rehash of the great film "Diabolique" from 1955. Has all the same markings, the overbearing husband, the tough 'other woman,' the twist-ending...Great stuff for riffing... Thanks for posting. Terrific performance from Ms. Hackett. weak endingyes joan hackett has a passing resemblance to julie andrews...just more refined features great movie! the new one the women woke from the dead Come On...Apologize...NO...U Go Claire! That Boys Cool...Perhaps He Should Help Kill The Bloody Bastard... Splendid Song At 10:55...Was Also Played In Story I Of The 1975 Classic Film:Trilogy Of Terror...
The Return of the Pink Panther 	Why wouldn't they show the Pink Panther diamond in all the films? my favourite pink panther movie by a mile love it One of the last memories I have of my grandfather is sitting in the living room watching this film with him during a Pink Panther marathon... 01:48 :))))) Untill we meet again casa solved,brilliand peter sellers comedy is not like it used to be back in the day. The robbery scene at the start is superbly staged. Sellers is hilarious as usual. AWESOME
Road Movie	uffffff yar ab to Bollywood pehle jese movies chor deya he is movie ke to trailer b poora nahi deksaka what rubbish
S*P*Y*S	awful awful awful movie Surprisingly good spy comedy with just enough plot-driven action and excitement to keep it interesting. Excellent dialogue, some great oneliners, all held together by the chemistry and charisma of Sutherland and Gould. In my opinion a worthy successor to MASH. The voice-over is supposed to remind us of Radar O'Reilly? The pee-pee comb!! You are truly a dumbass. @Flodderinbelgie It's a parody of the PA announcer from M*A*S*H. I saw this over summer vacation when I was ten years old at the local matinee, tickets were $1.  Didn't remember anything about this film except the scene where they went dance down the road.   @Zeanu the narration is a ripoff/homage to the tannoy announcements from MASH.  If you've ever seen that one, you might remember the final credits were done that way. I think they were trying to evoke memories of that, much in the way that they put the asterisks/bullet holes between the letters of the titles. If Gould and Sutherland were gonna make crap like this,they should have taken the TV roles in the series M*A*S*H. Not only Gould's an accomplished actor-to say the least-, he is a VERY sweet guy. i found the tape of trouble with spies for five bucks a couple years back. if i can ever get the hang of uploading stuff i'll have to put that movie on here. this is my favorite movie.
The Savage Is Loose 	FULL MOVIE: http://www.mediafire.com/download/xrots3b4kiso80u/The+savage+is+loose+%281974%29.avi He fucks his mother at the end. How nice! They should have killed the boy and eat him The boy has never seen any other woman except his mother; he becomes a man and starts feeling  natural things a man feels. It's just too bad that his mother is the only woman present yes it does. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and have never forgotten. It causes you to think. It was a neat movie.   what was wrong with the movie?
Scream of the Wolf 	great movie the arness boys should, at least,done some pushups. Oh, boy!  I've been waiting for years to catch up to this movie, hope it meets my expectations. This movie shows Clint Walker was a much better actor than he was ever given credit for. It's a pity, Clint Walker would've been great if he had been a real werewolf instead of some big guy pulling our leg.  They should've cast Walker in another film where he did get to play an actual werewolf to make up for this disappointing film. Maybe a recurring role in the 1980's Fox tv series WEREWOLF... If Clint Walker is a werewolf that going to be one huge beast. Sounds like the "Beast" is old Clint. He did get bite by a wolf and almost died. Just 30 minutes in hahhaha This is the Nature of you white edomite Crackkas Warning : This movie was made with real actors and not a bunch of CGI crap! The killer was actually 'ManBearPig'....... Shape shifter is a well known Native American phenomenon! Don't like it when (Clint ) plays the heavy!  He was good however!! Hard to see details in those dark scenes at 240p but free is free. Well I love Clint Walker but his character was just plain creepy in this movie. love the old movies thanks Interesting movie with a surprise ending.  Nice to see Peter Graves staying active after "Mission Impossible" ended on tv.  Here's a scene that will show why one should never skimp on the cost of silver bullets when hunting werewolves by using the cheaper lead ones:  41:55 22:30 The guy has a good point. Look at all the redneck scum these days who glorify their "hunting" escapades on this site. Trophy hunters have never been the good guys. The overall tone of this movie isn't pro-hunting, especially the ending. Clint Walker.
Le Sex Shop 	Is that Chanel Oberlin from scream queens? Idk she reminds me of her haha Wow she's hot! I was laughing at the end. Deym. SPONGEBOB?! The trailer song is HIGHS - Nomads..... :-) :) Is that the possessive girlfriend youtube girl? Im only gonna watch this movie because its with Evan and Emma together. Is it already available on DVD? It is, right? once upon a time, I was obsessed with 80's movies/actors. John Cusack being one of my favorites. I wanted to see this movie so bad! But I was "too young to watch a movie like that". I eventually got over the 80's (I still love the movies and all, im just not obsessed) and was not dying to see this. Now, here I am over a year later. Obsessed with American Horror Story- dying once again to see this movie.I WILL FIND IT ONE DAY!!!!! AND I WILL WATCH IT!!!! AND IT WILL BE MAGICAL!!!!! WHERE CAN I WATCH THIS . I Love this movie <3 what is the name of the song ? pls Where can I find this? American Sex Story? HAHAH. Omg, I wanna watch this. Emma Roberts* my bad  Ironic that Evan Peters and Emma stone would star in a movie together after the AHS series :P i want to see this!
Shoot It Black, Shoot It Blue 	this video seems much better quality than the original even the young black kid in the movie looks kinda cute
The Sister-in-Law 	please upload the whole movie Tv video Full movie pls ? I know the whole movie on this trailer of sister-in-law my sister-in-law also so trouble daughter-in-law to my parents & a bad sister-in-law to me & to my sister too. Seem to have issed this comment, sorry about that. Maybe you've already seen it, but in any case: the movie can be found here to the right on "moviemanfitnessfan"'s channell (Three parts).I hope that version is sufficient :) I remember watching this movie growing up!  I have a request.  Can you show the whole movie The Sister In Law on youtube?  It was an interesting movie to watch!
Space Is the Place 	hol up I've got to see this movie!!! LOL
Spasmo 	LOVE this film! It's not the best, but it's unique and I watch it every so often. Red herrings galore. Not your typical giallo.
Stavisky...	Le grand Charles Boyer est merveilleux dans "Stavisky." que churrasoooo
Steppenwolf	cannot ever portray this in a movie it doesn't even fit the proper "mood" of the book, that's what I was referring to. NIEN! (in captial letters) No thanks, I rather take a nap than to squander away hours of my life I will never get back watching this so call "book to movie adaptation".I mean just look at this trailer, its wayy too bright for starters and it looks like crap! nope, can't be bothered too busy staring into the i-phone, to even look up for an  o second. -today's modern attitude.I've read the book obviously, I pay attention and listen only if I am being addressed and the speaker is establishing basic fundamental basic human interaction, such as looking at the person they are talking to. Personally I've seen more of these basic interaction from chimps and monkeys more than from ppl. Hermann Hesse - "In fear I hurried this way and that. I had the taste of blood and chocolate in my mouth, the one as hateful as the other." One of my favorite quotes of his. Was also happy to hear it in one of my fav movies Blood and Chocolate.  @tommybarresi Saw both this one and "Siddartha" in rep theaters back in the 70s when they were often run as a double bill.  "Steppenwolf" was easily the best of the two adaptations.  "Siddartha" was very pretty (in a postcard way) but Steppenwolf  far more innovative.  I'm also a big fan of 1960s underground and experimental films that many of the techniques used here were inspired by. It looks dreadful. The book is sublime this is ridiculous @tommybarresi I guess you have to be high on something to enjoy the movie!  @barbabietolaspaziale Then why did they even give it the same name as the book!! Just ridding off of the success of the book no doubt! This movie looks so stupid compared to the book. It looks like somebody took one too many hits of acid when they made this movie, just the trailer looks crappy already no where the type of mode that the book was situated in the first place.  @teargas500  so true. or they say "it's dated". Like WHAT is not?  It's an experimental fine film. some flaws of its time, yes, but GREAT. hmm i can't see anything to remind me the book from this trailer.. i love the book, read it several times.
The Strange and Deadly Occurrence 	OMG, that's "Robert Stack" from the amazing show: Unsolved Mysteries from back in the day! Right? Didn't y'all recognize him? Well, I sure did I'm just saying. Lol. :) Ok, I gotta go get back to the movie 'cuz I just started watching it. See ya & have a blessed day. :) It's a good thing dad didn't notice that the heat was on when the windows were open.  That would have really been horrifying!!!  :) John Jacob..... Jingleheimerschmidt! Bet he got teased in school for that! Hence the.....issues. omg it's Stan Zbornak! I knew he looked familiar lmao.. the dad looks like Tony Goldwyn good movie AWESOME UPLOAD CLASSIC REPRESENTED IN THE FINEST WAY!!!THANKS!!! Good ol Robert stack always  had a facial expression like someone had thrust a bowling ball up his ass......................... Thank you for the light entertainment. I appreciate your time and work. :) Thank you for uploading this movie.  I am watching it while I update some websites.  I like this Dad because he's doing what a real Dad would do, especially when he says at 43:04 "Okay, get your sleeping bag and put it in our room".  That's great because that's what a real dad, who is caring and protective, would do.  I agree with "Seeking Pathways" comment.  A realistic movie with a kind and loving family. "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature" is in this A damn fine last 15 minutes! I liked this movie! Robert Stack talking about his shrinkage ROFL! ok movie thank you. 19:05 Vera Miles was a total Milf in this film. thanks! new title for movie...."the unsolved mystery"...lol michael I'm a genius with coke bottle glasses .
The Stranger Within 	fucking worst moment ever......its trash This movie was garbage 1:33 was that actually suppose to be scary?? LMAO Or "The Fight Over For A Penis" This is actually called STRANGER WITHIN!!!!!! it says right on the dvd.  I just saw this film...it's totally bulshit....I highly not recommended... Oh Billy, I thought you were done acting... ive seen those type of movies before total b.s. The title should'v been called "penis".  Baldwin RULES ! looks really thrilling
The Sugarland Express 	I wooon mah bay-bee back e.t. yes...but...but i have seen this....color purple really?? it s a good movie inspired by a true story from 1969 Great movie.  Thanks for uploading the clip.   Movies-and-Books-World a) It's not a competition, I've seen both and they're both goodb) Why compare the two? They're very different films in different genres. That's assuming you mean The Duelists, the Ridley Scott film of 1977 starring Harvey Keitel? If not, please inform me otherwise.
The Super Cops 	Simply put, folks, they don't make em like this anymore.  It was phenomenal in 1974, it's phenomenal in 2016 and it will forever be phenomenal. wish this was on dvd I just saw this on TCM. Great film from that era showing NYC. I live in NYC but was born in the 80s, but I wish I could've lived in NYC on the 70s, and hit up all the discos. I just watched this and thought it was great.  The real-life Greenberg and Hantz were as corrupt as they came. Not only that, they were incredibly cowardly, and they were suspected in several murders. One of them went to jail twice after he left the NYPD, the other lost his detective shield for drug smuggling. By any chance does anyone know if they the Real Life Cops portrayed in the movie had encounters the Legrands of Brooklyn as well as the Legendary Frank"Pee Wee" Matthews  and who was the Notorious Crime Family that they were fighting actually based on? Play it to a bust !!!(It's still that bad even today!!!)wwwdotcustomscorruptiondotcom,  Great movie about a couple of honest Cops. Something that is very rare and hard to find in most jurisdictions.I rate this as very entertaining and not as dramatic as Serpico, but fun with a serious side too. If you are or were a Cop, you will appreciate it quite a bit. Hopefully, you will appreciate it anyway. They don't make movies like this anymore. Problem is the corrupt system retaliated against these two fine cops because the corruption runs so deep in New York. Love Leibman and Selby ! I always hated most of the 1970s Westerns (with exceptions) especially the Spaghetti Westerns but I loved the 1970s crime dramas! 3 all time best (Based on true stories) 70s crime films: Super Cops/Serpico/The French Connection!!! U must be referring to David Selby - aka Richard Channing from Falcon Crest...damn good actor Wow it's Quentin Collins as New York cop. I saw this movie before I ever saw Dark Shadows in reruns, and when I saw The Quentin Collins episodes, I thought to myself, "Man, that guy looks familiar" but couod never figure it out coz I never saw this movie again. I grew up in NY around this time. Grubby as it looks in this movie, in person it looked a lot dirtier. Don't ever come to Australia, that's what Australian Police are like. Some nice birds in the movie though. Looovve this film. this film is available for purchase at warnerarchive[dot]com good movie isaw it when it came out where can i see the whole film? David is gorgeous!
TNT Jackson 	Its funny that I saw this movie when I was young little more cheesier now but still entertaining not bad In orthopedic medicine, traction refers to the set of mechanisms for straightening broken bones or relieving pressure on the spine and skeletal system.In other words, she'll break every bone in your body. Saw this movie on Epix on demand this morning, it was cheesy fun. I still don't get the tag line at the end "She'll put you in Traction".
The Taking of Pelham 	One Two Three Still, much better than new version! I accidentally saw the new one on TV1000 one day, as I casually turned on the TV, had no idea which film it is, but the story seemed so familiar, and after a while it hit me - this has to be a remake of that good old film I saw as a kid with Robert Shaw! And with all the effects and a great direction by Tony Scott, it still can't touch the original film! Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, I know that if you even try to show it as a comparison with some teen kid from nowadays, he/she will laugh at me, but, that's the way I feel about it! He's from Lancashire, btw ,that Robert Shaw the movie was a disappointment.  old denzel's black ass is going to save the city from old fat Joana Travolta.  LOL.. UFC legend rich Franklin born 10 5 1974 a few days after this films release and also the black hawk chopper introduced in October 1974.and in October 1974 Ali vs foreman fight GREAT FILM! 'NUFF SAID!!! Baby Stewie said "You'll be suuurrrrPRISED at wot's physically possible!". :) I love this movie ! Just watched this and it's the best in film fiction dialogue I really was impressed. Just think... a couple concealed carrying men could of ended all of this before it even started. Possibly even one man. One of the rare trailers from 70s America that doesn't spoil anything to the audience.It just sets you up for what you're about to see. Robert Shaw such a Great actor . . .died far to young at 51. . . One of the great NYC movies!  And that theme song, who can top that!?  Superb cast, tight pacing, excellent script - the remake is so weak in comparison! 1:09 The Mayor's Office has a king sized bed? Looks very scary. RIP Joseph Sargent, you will always be remembered for directing this crime thriller masterpiece and I hope the Academy Awards puts you in the online version of the In Memorial segment or it's going to get ugly. Action, drama, comedy, great script and superb acting makes for one of the most entertaining movies of the 1970's. Superb cast. This was filmed in the real New York Subway and the producers had to buy anti-hijacking insurance to prevent this from really happening..
The Teacher 	Nice movie, it just took me 2:20 to watch it :) This teacher is such a milf fit he BOSS Roses are red violets are blue I came for the thumbnailAnd so did you thinking about Emmanuel Macron .. "What kind of teacher you are?" Halfway into the video "Wait that's really not Josh Peck?!?!" All these adorable movies.. *sigh* I need to watch some rom coms.  Too bad I don't have a job right now and haven't been on a date for years . Flim sex kore f 0:08 Fat Zlatan Ibrahimovic wth everything about this trailer screams - "go get out, run for your life now" im already loving it ,,. julianna Moore is good looking for her age Damn, he screwed the mom AND daughter.Now if only he did it at the same time- that'd be whats called a superman. Rushmore Academy... Why is this recommended?? What kinds of porn is this?
Tell Me Where It Hurts 	what' s the name of the movie? that song is everything <3 GO PREDS HO! I saw this movie with my son we loved it and all the songs in it. What movie is this? I Love This Song I'm gonna watch it a couple of million times, just cause this deserve it.. pls sub in my Chanel if you write my survival episode (1) you will find my pls sub gay es cierto... entendi nada what is the filme name ? GO PREDS GO!
Terror on the 40th Floor 	So this is the tv movie that was released prior to Allen's The Towering Inferno hit the theaters.  Obviously the difference between the special effects in Trapped to the Oscar winning SFX in The Towering Inferno is clear. Plus the added heat of both Steve McQueen and Paul Newman gives TI the edge. This was released for TV a few months before The Towering Inferno debuted on the screen...Not bad for a TV skyscraper disaster...At least it kept the concept in your mind until TTI... This movie came out the same year The Towering Inferno did. @DC322  you can buy this at revenge horror dot com
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 	better than the original texas chainsaw massacre 2-4 whey they get fucked and rubbed before death...? bloody! Super film man I want the link of this movie please someone give me the link Holy Mother of Hong Jisoos Christ Worst remake ever this film is a fucking shit , the best texas chinsaw with Jessica Biel The most stupid move ever made, what a junk! I cant believe how bad this movie was such a disgrace to the texas chainsaw franchise What's Fuck This movie still ain't out? When I was little I always want to watch the movie when I first saw the trailer in theaters but that didn't happen because my mom say it may contain nudity (back then I was unconfrible of nudity, but I'm not anymore when I got older) I never watch a horror movie that's rated R in theater. i thought the trailer was better than the movie. but the movie wasnt awful i guess. id watch it again only watched it because alexandra daddario is so fucking hot hola I actually like this movie because even though its the same concept as the other 2 remakes, { 4 teenagers or alike traveling in a van and get in a house and then leatherface happens}, but this one has a twist on a story so it was good. It makes leatherface a good guy sort of { i was bullied back in the day and now i take revenge thing etc}.  I like this movie. This looked so cool when I first saw it... Is every horror movie have the main character that is a girl , that is stupid     Holloween , Friday the 13th , Nightmare on elm street , Texas chainsaw massacre , all the main horror movies , and all have the main characters are girls that make stupid decisions . I have the same emblem ghost recon wildland
That's Entertainment! 	<ahem> NOT in HD. so the trailer  lied After watching this movie in a theater when it was first released, I went home and watched President Nixon resign on live TV. "It will never happen again."Two years later....
Thieves Like Us 	trailers are just not this raw any more...they're just straight up manipulative and boring. This was the movie that got Louise Fletcher the role of Nurse Ratched in One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. The director and producers watched this movie to see if Shelley Duvall would be good in the role of Candy in Cuckoo's Nest, and instead decided that Fletcher would be good as Nurse Ratched. I recently saw this interesting movie on Netflix however, I can't seem to find the soundtrack from this movie anywhere!
This Is a Hijack 	i wanna watch this movie!!!! Adam Roarke!!! crazy Larry and dirty Mary fame!!
The Three Musketeers 	This movie is brought to you by writers of the Matrix Trilogy and Directed by Michael Bay (Explosions). I wish this was a series hai Wow, they had airships back then!! 0_0 Honestly, this isn't a good movie. If you know the series, you'd be bitterly disappointed watching this. And it has one trait that all American adoptations have, which I hate in particular. The American pronounciation of French names. It's almost like they do it on purpose, like they didn't even try... And I'm guessing they didn't. Even the fantastic 'man in the iron mask' has this problem. Look I was able to properly pronounce D'Artag  at 10, and while I do live in Europe, my first language isn't in the same language group as French. It's no ''harder'' for me to pronounce French, and I can do it with relative ease, and I'm not special at all. I can't be the only one who got an assassins creed kinda vibe from this movie I don't care what anyone says, this movie was fucking brilliant and surprisingly faithful to the book, airship Peter pan battles aside lmao i cant express how shit this movie is shit movie ay. milla jovovich is the UGLIEST person ever . gross looking mut shit actress ruined the movie in the opening scene. Skip this shit and watch the BBC series, it's so much better xx Mr Darcy, Will Turner, and Charlie in the same movie? Sign me up! Airships?? In a movie which shows a story which happened in the 17th century?? I understand it's 2000's movie,but special effects shouldn't be there in this measure!! It is an...entertaining movie,let's say,but faaaar faaaar away from Dumas's story! R.I.P Dumas This is a Dumas movie. Amirite? Shit's about to get MEDIEVAL..literally i think there will be part 2 bbecause this is suck! i mean suck...i love you milla! please paul w.s.anderson do this movie again but this time make it better please! Dumas is still rolling in his grave Rather entertaining film but why the airships? The film could have been without them especially since they were impossible to build with 1600 Tech,. ik vraag me af waarom er geen vervolg kwam, want het einde gaf teken voor een vervolg, net als the golden compass I just came here for Logan Lerman LOL
Three the Hard Way 	Jive turkeys DOPEST music in these movies the brother cesman 83 said that why they didn't put Richard roundtree in the movie and make it 4 the hard way its because 3 is the magic number baby can you dig it oooyyyyeeeeeee! "Art Imitating Life"coming to a "CITY NEAR YOU","Rockaby baby........",lol.unfortunately to many walkin round in an "ALTERED STATE",aint prevy to "heads or what's planned for their tails",lol,yet we pay to see/read the cleff notes on these she igans,which aint gonna MANIFEST to garnered them the VICTORS,lol. oyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Re: Richard Roundtree's (Shaft) absence: He was filming the "Shaft" TV series (YES...there IS one!) probably around the same time as this movie was being filmed.  So he would not have been available to participate without MGM suing him to pieces! Seeing the part with THE IMPRESSIONS in the studio was a ill and funky moment,right there.The 3 GODFATHERS of CINEMA SOUL. A must own film. A well done film considering the budget. man that's bad ASS ! At that Point in time Richard probably wanted too much money or more of a lead role... Shaft was main stream compared to this movie. I wonder why they didn't throw in Richard Roundtree and make it "Four the Hard Way"? hahaha Brwon came in blasting.. I remember my dad watching all these movies when I was a kid The Bad Guy in this movie is insane--without bruthas and sistas--the world would have NO soul!! @ oldschoolbx1970This movie hit the big screen when I was 4 years old.It brings back so many memoriesWhen my Family use to go the moviesTogether in Harlem On 125th street
Thunderbolt and Lightfoot	 wow that's a funky track looks like fun ! Busey IS in the movie MAYBE watch the movie, be sure of something BEFORE making a comment/mistake. BETTER TO REMAIN SILENT AND BE THOUGHT A FOOL RATHER THAN OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND REMOVE ALL DOUBT.words to live by Thumbs down because the uploader thought this was a Gary Busey movie. yes he is, he works with lighfoot as a landscape gardner GARY BUSEY IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE!!!!! Even though IMDB says so.....Look up the actor your thinking of, his name is George Kennedy.... Dirty Harry meets The Dude.. looks good.

The Towering Inferno 	This is how real movies were made. Robert Vaughn and Steve McQueen starred in The Magnificient Seven who starred with Faye Dunaway in The Thomas Crown Affair who starred with William Holden in Network Robert Vaughn and Steve McQueen starred in The Magnificient Seven who starred with Faye Dunaway in The Thomas Crown Affair who starred with William Holden in Network 9/11 confirmed. Inside job How is this "entertainment"? It's sick. Who watches stuff like this for fun? It makes me think of those poor people who were trapped in the World Trade Center. I remember watching this in theater! I was 12 or 13 and  I had nightmares about fires, being caught in one & not being able to get out, for a week! riveting absolutely riveting Now this movie should be on MST3K! Principal photography ended September 11, 1974. Die Hard brought me here. The author of "Nothing Lasts Forever", which was adapted for the first Die Hard, was inspired by this movie. i was so excited when i was a kid that my dad was going to take me to see this i couldn't sleep the night before.great innocent times O.J Simpson caught me off guard lmao An amazing film, especially for it's time when there were no CGI effects at all. Everything was miniature models. It was nominated for best picture What caused the fire anyway? One of the definitive disaster movies but I still prefer The Poseidon Adventure. The color and clarity of this look really good....though of course, the film's utter trash :) Even movie trailers in the 70's gave away the ending. I wonder if O.J Simpson and Robert Wagner discussed getting away with murder during the filming of this.... Whoever was responsible for casting this all-star bonfire, assuming their still alive, they most likely profusely regret casting O.J Simpson as the Head of Security I remember seeing this at the drive in and in the theater.. I was 4. Guess my dad liked this movie a lot to take us to see it twice
Le trio infernal 	I love this movie!!!! Romy Schneider is the best actress ever!
Truck Turner 	" Hide your mamas, the big brother of soul is making a new music... and it's MEAN JIVE!!" Best trailer ever!!!!!! is that the voice from the transformrs cartoons in the 80s?? great movie Good old time currensy the life of Harvard Blue brought me here Best breakfest served - Big Black Dick slapped on your cheek One dislike = one moron. "He's a skip tracer, the last of the bounty hunters, living on blood money and borrowed time." So this is what Uhura does on the side when she is not schlepping away at the com desk. "I brought some beer" - Best Pickup Line Ever I worked for this director, on and off for many years, a real character, utterly brilliant and the coolest cracker in Hollywood! south park made me watch it Best Movie Trailer Ever! Yaphet Koto AKA Dr. Ka ga/Mr Big I loved this movie. RIP. Mr. Hayes Brother Isaac Hayes is the man.
Horror High 	fun film, though the kid really deserved it afterall, man I can't believe IMDB has that 'Return' movie as a sequel to this, when it is clearly not, they even called it return as a joke. Good to see Pat Cardi again. This played on late-night TV in the mid to late 70's as "The Twisted Brain". Seen it many times over the years and recently here at Youtube and as a kid from the 70's who remembered the monster craze,  all I have to say to Code Red DVD is thanks for posting the trailer, and also for not forgetting this one! This film is a prelude to Carrie, and the slasher films of the late 70's Don't get me wrong...I love this movie. Used to be Twisted Brain on Cablevision 's Shock Theatre!!! The trailer reminds me of an old joke about the movies, but with my own twist. A breast being kissed - rated X.A breast sliced off with a sword - rated R.A hand being chopped off with a paper cutter - rated PG. It's a modern day Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde! This flick is actually alright. It was sort of ahead of it's time I think. It's plot prefigured later films like Carrie, Christine and even Revenge of The Nerds. It also has some pretty good shock gore bits like a victim being dissolved in an acid vat, another being dismembered with a paper cutter and another getting stomped to death with a pair of cleeted shoes. Very decent teen shock horror flick from the 70's. This is some stupid bullshit. I didn't know there was a sequel. I will definitely look into that. Thanks for posting about it. I watched this movie recently and really enjoyed it. I have it on one of those sci-fi movie box sets. It sounded interesting so I gave it a try and found out it was a really fun movie.  I think Pat Cardi is really good in this....and Rosie Holotik...also in Don't Look in the Basement....has quite a cult following....but my son thought Austin Stoker was the only half decent actor in this....some people think I have pretty low standards in film taste....however..... I really liked this movie.  The Code Red DVD transfer looked amazing! lol, PG Heavens to Murgatroid!  Thanks for posting!  If this flick played locally back in the mid-70's, I don't remember it.  Exciting trailer!  I recall Pat Cardi from one of schockmeister William Castle's last movies,  1966's "Let's Kill Uncle".
The Ultimate Thrill 	rarelust has it for a download. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1sI-OuRjX0 http://product.half.ebay.com/The-Ultimate-Thrill-VHS-1989/3141720&tg=info It was filmed in Vail, Colorado.
Uptown Saturday Night  	G 0:03 Cosby rape face Not the original trailer.  One of the Best! Damn Cosby beard nappy You're correct they made this movie to counter blackploitation. big cast cant wait 4 the remake Adam MCkay will be directed hopefully big Will Martin Denzel jamiee & tyler This wasn't true blaxploitation.

Love Cal Cal, Aka Calvin "Handsome" Lockhart!!!!!
Visit to a Chief's Son  	This score is now available on CD for the first time at Music Box Records. Keine Ahnung das das nicht mein Ding ist.Das ist eine Aufgabe der Filmindustrie, so eineProduktion endlich auf DVD zum Verkaufan zu bieten. Also da bekommt man bock auf denganzen Film, gibt es den schon auf DVD?
Welcome to Arrow Beach  	The Sandy Blonde actress is Joanna Pettet..who was a knockout in her days, formerly married to actor Alex Cord, also hunk back in the day. Sort of like a Angelina /Brad Pitt glamour couple in those days. It was released in 1974. @realisticsugar He also played in a Columbo episode about this time and looked unwell , to me , in that, bless @brujaria but thanks for uploading @brujaria Also , Lawrence Harvey died in 1973, how could this be made in 1974. This is a masterpiece @drStrano It's available on Stagevu.  com  This wasn't Laurence Harvey's "directorial debut".  He'd previously directed "The Ceremony" in 1963. @lmyinca she and harvey worked together in the night gallery episode: the caterpillar. Yeah...I would have run a mile from ol Larry Love this film, haven't seen it for yrs, it was on tv. Just shows that she should have hitched a ride with the hippy not middle-aged cancer-riddled Harvey! This movie played last night at the New Beverly in Los Angeles. What a trip! See it if you can. seeing meg foster semi nude is the only reason to see this it seems. but i would see it, anyone got the full movie on here? this film rules I have it! I saw it on tv one night and got taken away by nostalgic beauty Looks like good camp....the music, the acting...
Where Have All the People Gone 	Is it me, or am I the only one who saw the similarity between this movie and "The Omega Glory" episode of Star Trek: The Original Series? why do these movies and other posts in u tube..wave around in the beginning at least like the wind is blowing at the scenes peter graves is a terrible actor...talk about wooden! everyboody is gone to raptrue A hospital? What is it?  Well it's a big building with,well we don't have time for that now.  What a day to quit smoking..what a day to quit drinking..what a day to quit sniffing glue.  Airplane and Airplane II had great comedic moments throughout.  The series police Squad with Leslie Nielson got it all started off. I like how they all start laughing while eating even though everyone in the world just died. Movie of the week music is by Burt Bachrach.  Very cool! I caught a flaw where early on the daughter had named the silent woman "Anne" (32:41), but later referred to her as "Jenny" (34:16) BEFORE she asked her what her name was (56:37), only then discovering that it was Jenny. "Where has all the talent gone?" I wish youtube would put a "focus" button on this movie. Blurriness give me a headache. This was a good movie. It seems like it's the end of the world as we know it yet PETER GRAVES' HAIR STILL LOOKS FABULOUS in every scene!!! Remember watching this just after it came out. I feel old now. As movies have changed so much since then. Back then it was all about the acting. Now a little CGI and everyone thinks it was a good movie. For all those acting overly-nostalgic... the 1970s were perhaps the most turbulent times in modern U.S. history. And, the air was unbreathable, the cars were terrible, products were cheaply-made, and society was on the brink of collapse (or so it felt). The 2010s are the new 1970s, basically, but many aspects are way better now. Stop groaning about a decade that was, in actuality, seemingly grungy and negative (save for certain things, like rock music). I'd much rather have lived through the 1990s or something. At least our economy was strong, our budget balanced, military surplus high, and unemployment relatively low - across all races.Just think about what a grown adult would have thought about the 1970s. You're all complaining about today; whereas, a person who had lived through the 1950s would definitely have found great fault with the 1970s. Everyone thought American was going down the drain, in the 1970s. Beautiful Time Movies This is a pretty good movie. I remember watching it when I was in the Army stationed at Ft. Benning That intro for the movie of the week gives me nostalgic butterflies.... You know I'm positive I've watched this movie growing up it's just a shame the movie didn't go a little bit longer, to show how they adjusted in the New World.        but nevertheless it's still a 1970 movie. that I enjoyed watching. Reminds me of Earth Abides a bit.
Where the Lilies Bloom 	This is a great movie.   It will not age and is appropriate for all family members.  Thank you for sharing! Bitter sweet.  Wonderful movie.  Thank you. Thank you for adding this movie. It's one of my all time favorites.  I watched it with my kids where they were young and will now try and watch it with my grand kids. Brilliant Movie , never seen anything like it , thank you MissDiane 1962 , great acting , cheers :) I was privileged to have a wonderful family but my father was an orphan and made his own way in life. He never complained and took extraordinary care of his family. He was my role model for a positive outlook. A sweet movie, of life and love. I had a wonderful childhood , grew up on 6 acres  and had a tennis court, lots of toys , trampolines and bikes etc. I loved living soooo much, as an adult I HATE LIFE AND COULDNT CARE IF I DIED TOMORROW. As I am hypoacusic , I beg you to add subtitles ! ---Thanks a lot ! --There are most people like me . I learnt 4 things about Appalachians people : they are stubborn, they work hard , they are unsympathetic , and they have a sweet heart !Thank you for uploading this film, Miss Diane ! Great movie. thanks for sharing, take care.CC I am so glad I ran across this! Such a beautiful film! Thank you! very nice thanks!! Good movie better than what I thought it mite be. some people just dont care its in their jeans  it all comes from the invassion of indian america to be strong and careless of others was the norm to grab land be criel was the norm as i said it was all in german blood of inferiority and evil race in which they where and still even killing poor indians for self gratitude and power over a harmless their never will be a america its indian land and alway will evn in thanksgiven day when the indians gave food ant thought to the whit man they spat it in their face.usa is a sick sick land because of political gred and curruption hence entering into th mind of the poplace . Thank you for uploading this! I haven't seen this movie in ages. I remember my mom taking me and my brothers to this movie when it was in the theater.....gosh the world's a different place. What year is this supposed to take place? Love the roof patching scene....I'm a 53 year old woman who just bought her first house and is dead broke....that was me the other day, up on the 3rd floor roof w/the tarry goo.... does anyone know the names of the songs eldest sings? my grandmother use to sign them too and i would love to learn them. I love movies like this reminds me of simpler times
Where the Red Fern Grows 	i like the original better does anyone feel like u wanna watch a movie and then u wanna watch the trailer? i do :P the family's fi cial woes were a   typical situation in those days..someone has to get that joke You see the dogs and you know they're gonna die does anyone know the titles of the music displayed by this trailer LIFE LESSON YES!!! THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR ME. Today me class r watching this movie but the older on cause we read the book in class and its so sad:( Coon hunt. Lol Who's watching this in 2015 I hated it when old Dan and little Ann died I have two dogs a Great Dane and a collie named old Dan and little Ann the best dogs a girl in the osark mountains could ever have recently we won a Huntin tournament in the blue ridge mountains i thought billy was blond from the book...werid Everyone looks different then in the other movie Only watched this because the book said this had a movie I have to read this book in order to get into my advanced Language Arts class for sixth grade. I heard it's really sad, I'm on chapter 16. I love, love, love this movie and the sound track is beautiful!   Maybe I can add this to the 5th grade reading book talk. I was al the way ti chapter 14.. chapter 13 was so .... it just suprised me .. my class were just so freaked out i love thisim soo cryingand im useing my dads im girl not a boy I read this book.It was so sad at the end though
The White Dawn 	This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I have never forgotten it. The Inuit were depicted as peaceful and wise. The bad eggs were 2 of the whalers whose weaknesses were greed, selfishness and hedonism. The music is beautiful, the cinematography is spectacular. Unforgettable movie. That's great movie! They don't do movies like that anymore!  hi kalena , my name is timothy bottoms. i was in the movie and spent 4months on baffin island and traveled all over.i met a woman who when very young knew the whalers who the story is about.all the people i met were very cool and kind people.tough life up there but poles are shifting and times are changing again. all the best to you. Hello Kalena. Have you watched this movie? Nobody lives like this anymore. This story was set in the 1890s and depicted first contact. The Inuit are depicted(I believe faithfully) as humane, gentle and resourceful. The whalers represent archetypes but their responses appear to be in keeping with the mentality of the times. What in particular have you seen that strikes you as judgmental? What do you see that appears savage? Again, have you seen the full movie or just this trailer? This is bullshit...this mocie is judgmental and makes my inuit race seem savage and its completely not the way we live our lives and its wrong people actually think we're like this!! Wtf?? please pots the movie
Willie Dynamite 	Ed 'n Papeen sayin 2 thums up, way up (my ass). I want that car. Does anyone know why this film didn't win an academy award? I've watched it 29 times and will be showing it at a feminist organization. Where's the Count ? The original pimp of Sesame Street Before counting numbers with Big Bird, he was counting Benjamins in his hands. this is soooo disturbing.... Okay, I'm gonna build a time machine, travel back to the 70's, and kick someone's ass. Thought D stands for Dick I have to watch this movie  Dog-gone ~ it's Gordon from Sesame St. summon the Pimp Counsel & gather all the hos to watchWillie Dynamite (1974) Trailer The nigga from Sesame Street? That's what's up! GORDON!!!!!!! So this is Black Dynamite's father.  That's that dude! what a bosssss
A Woman Under the Influence 	This is my favorite movie. What a great actress. Oscar or not.
Wonder Woman 	Well BVS was terrible, but maybe this will be better as a marvel fan, I hope this is good. DC needs to stop making shit movies One has to admit: This doesn't look like a clusterfuck. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. too skinny.. This trailer was better than any trailer Marvel have done FOR YEARS! Now just don't suck Wonder Woman, I'm counting on you! I just have to say that the Warrior music was literally like 2 parts of the song repeated like 50 times. Interesting how they used a song made for League of Legends in a superhero film.The "We have to rise" repeated over and over was annoying for me, probably because I've only listened to the original and it's annoying having the same phrase over and over when "We have to rise / Above the best and prove yourself" is in the original :/. I was so bored watching this; also, using the same shots mutiple times in the span of almost two minutes? Not a good sign. I had no expectations going in but after seeing this ... Ugh, well I hope this trailer was just crap and not indicative of the actual movie. Fags and bland millennials unite. A terrible Wonder Woman movie at last! Please, please, don't be as painful to watch as your last two films DC So wonder woman confirmed new character for LoL? I cant wait for Captain Marvel movie. I feel uncomfortable when An Imagine Dragons song isnt complete. I was not planning to see this movie. Until I saw this trailer. Good trailer but I don't like how the Germans are portrayed as the main bad guys when it was most of the world leaders who continued the war. It's not World War 2 with the Nazis; It's World War 1/The Great War. A war where one side fired over 4 million shells in a single hour. Where the shock waves were so intense that an observer on the side firing them could not light a match from the intensity of the shock waves of the explosions on the enemy lines. Where a man who was caught trying to escape was convinced that it was his duty to be executed to prevent others from showing cowardice as well. To skinny BATTLEFIELD 1 WOMAN EDITION THE MOVIE People are finally realizing Warriors by Imagine Dragons is an amazing song. Diana: Warrior Princess ........So they want us to believe not a single person decided to shoot at her feet or other exposed body part? "I see a gold shield!  Shoot at it!" "But sir, our bullets can't penetrate, shouldn't we shoot at exposed......" "SHOOT THAT GOD DAMN INDESTRUCTIBLE SHIELD" I love how they used Warriors by Imagine Dragons (my favorite band)!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Year Without a Santa Claus 	HAHAHA THAT'S MY FAVORITE TOO :P dude! Santa was ice king!! that explains why he dreamed all those unhappy things lol The Year Without a Santa Claus 1974 OnIine -- Visit >> https://plus.google.com/104890388292033276937/posts/cK7nYqgp6Tg "I dreamed unhappy things" does that mean the entire special was a dream? Production Director   KAIEN XAORU  The way he says it really concerns me. Santa needs to see a shrink to release those demons. LoveeThiSMovie  This delightful special aired every year at Christmas time on ABC for six years from 1974 to 1980 until it went into syndication. who doesnt love i dreamed unhappy things? best line ever MINE TOO! it makes me laugh so much ! best christmas movie ever
Young Frankenstein 	This is the niceist movie i ever see!!! I advise eeeveeeerybody to watcccch it :) https://twitter.com/dbc1f01543fe63c5a/status/822789097454469121 "in black and white.... no offense." Rewatched it after a long time and was dying laughing. rip Gene "Roll, roll, roll in the hay!!"R.i.p Mr Wilder. Ciao Gene, salutami Marty, Madeline, Peter e Kenneth.R.I.P. R.i.P gene Wilder They never even mentioned a small part of the deaf mute played by Gene Hackman! r.i.p. gene wilder. Isn't that Mel Brooks himself announcing the trailer? The best Wait why is there a myspace link at the end I only found this film hilariously funny when I was stoned, when I watched it the second time I realised I had only being laughing at Igor's massive eyes the whole time 2:15  You can really tell the guy was an artist when even the trailer is done with that special touch (... "no offence"). :') Reminds me of Hitchcock's trailers. Mine is better In black and white, NO OFFENSE.
Zandy's Bride 	Stellar cast and performances, Hackman, Ullman, Eckert,Tyrell,HD Stanton the first two-thirds is wonderful, the story, Big Sur, cinematography, direction. They veered off track when he goes off for his soul search in SF and apparently from the novel it was based on, Lillian Bos Ross' novel, "The Stranger." I understand the screenwriter/studios were responsible for that. If they'd have stayed with the direction they were headed, it could have been a great film much like Jan Troell's other much better films, "The New Land" and "The Immigrants. Now I want to read the novel, but it was a treat to watch fine actors work their magic. We owe our immigrant ancestors a LOT. just saw the movie on tcm loved it and I don't like older movies it was by accident aspect ratio fail bro. The real life in the west too bad he isn't good looking. I mean I would watch the movie if he was This is my favorite movie, love both Gene and Liv. You squashed the video.
Zanna Bianca alla riscossa 	c quoi le titre de film svo bellissimo....grazie bellissimo....grazie secondo me sarebbe meglio inquadrare tutto lo schermo Troppo bello il film ;D !!! fa schifo e molto bello il film
Zorro translation. 	namoosadeenbry Zorro was inspiration for batman The best zorro movie ever made!! This movie has an excellent script, acting, story, cinematography, etc., it really is the full package for me, since I was a child. it's been a while since I've seen this movie.I had this on DVD both of them. name of the song vault Disney brought me here The best zorro movie ever made! Hellywood promoting unfaithfulness and no commitment, by promoting sex out of marriage instead of how it should be. Filthy hellywood. But it's not all bad. I like the Spanish vibe. It's inspiring. One time an Egyptian woman asked me what my name was. I paused, considering if I should say Alex or Alejandro, but went with my actual name, and said it slowly so she would understand. She squinted her eyes at me with a smile 'cause she thought I was trying to be romantic. hahaha! ZORRO VS. REVERSE FLASH this is a great movie I watched this movie as a kid on vhs all the time. I fucking loved it lol GRACIA very underrated movie I think I will watch this movie They just don't make adventure movies like this anymore. Well, there are a small few: "Fury Road," "The Spirit," and the 1st and 4th "Pirates" movies. But otherwise, it's hard to find a movie with such excitement, not taking itself too seriously, that isn't polluted with over-saturated CGI. Beautiful movie and Beautiful people......a trailer to be looking-forward to.... he wore black pirate dc superhero costume when he try rescue his horse fav movie ever
Aaron Loves Angela 	man, does any one have a clue what the background song/score is? This made me smile. Lol. I saw this for the first time tonight and I recognize those apts. Got a real good friend that lives in them. Lol.  Where's the rest of the film?
Apache Blood 	Cochise was the Apache leader that tore up the American Military for about 11 years in southern Arizona.  Ol' Stubby  with glasses needs an arrow through his neck. Can't find a Cherokee woman to be in the movie? Just paint a white woman brown and you're set Just really shows how crazy and stupid our past people really were and DumbA bible thumping Christians Heck they had know idea what it means and still don't to this day. thank you for thegreat vidio 2:53 is too awkward to watch Drama builds up in the last 30 minutes. Quite a good movie I am looking for a film I saw about 30 years ago all i remember is a scene where a man in a bowler hat and suit is surrounded Comanches (Or maybe Apaches)  and he is offering them jewelry for his life but one of the Indians kills him with an arrow villians to death. Can anybody help me here, what is the movie?. All I remember is that the movie was very violent and ended in the Indians torturing the well its a odd western the part with the guy in the water slowly drowning and the other tied up and the Indian puts a bag over his head with a rattle snake in it was quite shocking something I've never seen before or since Good Weak, Chato's Land anytime better ! She tragically chose the man that loved her....? hard THANK YOU the story line lacks  something .  the ending is just weird. Very average western to say the least.  But I do think Jody McCrea could be passed off as Bruce Boxleitners older brother. old friend
The Art of Crime 	I wouldn't want Jennifer Aniston back either. is that andy dufresne? why am i watching 2014 movie TRAILER IN 2017 I love John hawkes!! Sad that I thought this was coming soon... and it was released 2 years ago! i almost thought 1 of the kidnappers was DJ squall from the new guy i saw this movie a few months ago. Its awesome. highly recommend. WTF...This movie had a budget of 6 million and grossed only 5.5 million...not acceptable....something is wrong .. this is a remake of bette midler and danny devito  ruthless people boo mos def!!!! This movie is NOT a comedy HIS NAME IS MOS DEF I don't understand what this is about... I Bear this movie just becoz im the FAN OF JENN <3 That tan and brown sport jacket alone captures the time period. Why does this remind me of the movie RUTHLESS PEOPLE? so a shitty Ruthless People? _alimony UHG!..  1:31How STUPID do u have to be... Isn't this just a remake of Ruthless People
Barry Lyndon 	Excellent film!! Hate old trailers :   BLABLABLA   said "This movie is ...." Barryyy Lyndon hd moviee heree => https://twitter.com/dbc1f01543fe63c5a/status/822787291340881920 Spoilers in the trailer, and a voiceover for a movie which already has voiceovers. Masterpiece film, but typical lackluster 70s trailer, haha It's amazing how many great roles O'neal had in the 70's - and even more amazing how the roles dried up once the 80's it... I wonder what happened? Awesome book! Funny and it worked for me! this film is on a whole different level. every shot could be a painting from that time When ever I want to watch something very engrossing with good character build, drama, and action, the 70's never fails. It's been proclaimed as the last era directors actually competed to get you to watch their films. films. these were films. not m
Best Friends 	CHARLES LEE RAY IT'S ALIVE!!!! (chuky) When is this coming out I wanna see it!! I can't wait for Nostalgia Critic to review this in a couple of years. I can't wait for Nostalgia Critic to review this in a couple of years. "I'm in the gold business", is that like being "in the computer business"? Tommy Wiseau is a gift from god, he is an angel. Oh hi mark If this movie doesn't have Tommy saying "You're tearing me apart Lisa!" at least once, I'll be very disappointed. looks fucking great "Who are you?""We are going to my paradise." I did not WHYYYYY LIZZA...WHYYYYYY. "what a great party and you invited all of my friends good thinking." You can trust me. Come on guy.Yup, I'm definitely getting in that hearse. Oh hi mark.... In a minute bitch... Don't touch me muddafuckerrr!!!! You're tearing me apart Lisa! 0:21 - this trailer doesn't look that good, but this line... this sign Greg is holding, this is my favorite movie quote of all times now. Just genius. I honestly can't wait for this movie
Beyond the Bermuda Triangle 	So when does Donna Mills take off her top? The movie basically good.... available on DVD.....campy as it is,the stories of disappearances ARE TRUE. At 17:44 discussion was made about the freighter "Marine Sulphur Queen" and how it disappeared without a trace. Not entirely true. Wreckage including a life preserver and a board with part of the ship's name had washed up on shore. The board with the ship's name was blackened on the reverse side, leaving experts to believe the ship had exploded. good movie seen it about 3 times... Remember Movie, good memories. Love DonnaMills I don't remember the title of a TV movie.  It is where a group of friends are on this yacht in the middle of the ocean treasure hunting.  They found chest with an idol in it.  Who ever gets close to it is possess and controlled by it...that is all I remember. old oakland. Fred's second to last film appearance. Nice job. Miss you Fred. I wanna eat Donna Mills' pussy THANKS... a lot! locked.....nice..beyond...movie... Pretty good movie. I first saw it about 40 years ago on tv on a late night movie. Hey you know the best part in this movie was , The boring ending, thank god I skipped through it in the first 9 min.s of the movie . Well that's 9 min.s I won't get back of my life ! keep shareing classic movies......Thx Nostalgic, campy, past era reminiscent, really brings me back to the 1970's .  Thanks for the upload. This movie is about my life Lol Bell bottom pants. The sun comes up in the east and goes down in the west; question is why don't the plane pilot go toward the sun off the east coast due west... ?? Strange
Bite the Bullet 	I salute you Sir...you did a great job with one of my all-time FAVES !  I can recite this film, WORD FOR WORD ! This, The Shootist, The Cowboys, and Pat Garret are the best westerns before Unforgiven ( and still just as good) This is awesome well done GREAT job, filmbuff. Not widely known or recognized but one of my faves. Lots of stars and the age old story of two pals getting old & not knowing it or acting like it. AAAAA!! My sister and I had to sit through this in 1976 or so just to see "Tommy".  It was a double feature, and my mom made us see both. My sister probably liked it more than I did because of the horses. I saw the movie which was a Japanese-dubbed version on TV. film avvincente ed istruttivo in cui si dimostra che gli umani, per quanto siano capaci, motivati, solidali o competitivi, non sono migliori dei cavalli, loro strumenti e vittime
The Black Bird 	Just finished watching this movie it's such a cute movie with a great ending We are truly living in the last days this world is getting dirty and dingy every day sad but so true. People keep complaining about the religion, but the point of this movie was to show the struggle between homosexuality and religion. My friend went through this same stage and it hurt them a lot. I went through it as well when I was trying to figure out why I didn't have sexual desires because I was called a freak. Just because you are gay, doesn't mean you can't be religious. That's what the movie was showing. Also, the movie also symbolizes accepting yourself and moving on. You saw this when the main character accepted themselves and then (SPOILER ALERT) their sister came home. This movie showed what it's like to be religious and to be gay. I felt very uncomfortable at times.... but it was ok Wowww these comments are interesting were in a different time mane it's not the end of the fuckin world he'll you really wonna get technical half the population of human race are gay and or bisexual smdh most of these actors directors etc are gay it's not a death sentence my god that's one of our many problems we face in this world somebody always in the background judging or making ill comments on ones sexuality or preference I mean errrybody is entitled to ones own opinion and yes ignorance is still bliss in 2016 but cry me a river it's not even that serious in todays generation and I agree the whole aspect of this young man praying to what they persevere to be a white jesus threw me off and as far as this foolishness of being gay is a choice well I don't know it all depends on how you look at it cause at the end of the day no matter what the situation we all have a choice in everything we do so I don't disagree with you there but all this foolishness about one going to hell behind ones sexuality is crazy that were the case half the population of human race would be in this place you call hell  no I wouldn't want my future son to go there the battles one would faces as a gay man but you  can't choice witch direction your child goes pertaining to ones sexuality with todays generation it's best to keep an open mind even if you don't agree with ones lifestyle period it's all about ones perspective.... when i watched this trailer i didn't spot the white dude who was actually a big influence in the whole story. xD good trailer! 1:28 that girl is fucking beautiful, damn that short hair! <3<3 Eddy Long approved this movie. it was so cute,and good also cool. Time are changing  is going to be a piece full life. I'm literally just now finding out about this movie! I wanna see it!! This movies was Garbage asf Why put religion in movies about us gays ? Like that shit getting dead lmao The  book is different.  Loved the movie all the same. This movie is great. I was hesitant and skeptical to watch it, but I'm glad I took this Sunday evening to. It's definitely in my top five for gay films. It has definitely change the future me, especially how I would be a father, if by small chance I become one. Great Movie! Cried a couple of times! God Loves all of us! I just got done from watching this movie on Netflix and I gotta say,its a sad but great movie that I recommend people should watch!
Black Moon 	Downloadby Rodrigo/Cariocahttp://cariocabaixeaqui.blogspot.com worst trailer of all time Aha this is the French original. There are also an American version from 1986. I hate these trailers that have to tell you ever plot point in the movie, thereby ruining the film! If you thought the trailer was riveting, wait till you sit through the whole movie. 0:42 the director should cut this scene faster. BLACK MOON should come out on Black-Ray. lovely motonymphWhat is wrong with you? They didn't kill that animal, don't you know about special effects? That is the art of filmmaking creating an illusion making look the impossible possible. They don't hurt any animals in here.  that is one wild trailer To motonymph's point, if this had been a true on-screen killing of an animal, the film would be a degenerate piece of filth and not art. There were indeed mainstream movies from the past century depicting such acts, and there is no historical or artistic context with which to reasonably justify them. @motonymph hahaha, you idiot! Cow, pig, chicken... every day killing. I'm really mad that I just watched that trailer and all I saw was a badger get run over. It's funny how some people don't notice the cut-away at 0:42 Because of the clearly abrupt cut and change of camera angle at the moment of impact- your care for animals is admirable, though! :) badger badger badger badger badger SPLAT badger badger
Boss Nigger 	The pre-election video of Barack Obama is "Boss Nigger trailer" Back when SJWs didn't exist id watch it looks funny with lots of action. America is great! Beasley from the URL sound just like the narrator. Boss Nigger! They were going to make a sequel with him in Medieval England and call it "Sir Nigger" DAMN IT ENGINEER, AGAIN?! A modern day reboot would be called Boss N-Word. can somebody please remake this It's as if _Blazing Saddles_ and _Dolemite_ had an illegitimate child together...and it's beautiful. :) Is it wrong to be a honky and love the trailer? RATED PG That chrome mare's leg, though. Pretty sweet signature weapon. I got into trouble once singing the song off of this by mistake I like how he emphasized "Fred Williamson IS boss nigger". Kinda changes the meaning of the sentence. WSTHH brought me here!!! Ouuuh wee Blacksploitation at its FINEST!!!! Loving this gem!! white woman got kissed by a NIGGER BOSS NIGGER now they need to make a QUEER ATHEIST MOVIE Thumbs up if you're watching the trailer because of the title. This may be the single funniest video I've ever seen.....
A Boy and His Dog 	I'm glad this trailer existed, I used this as a presentation for a class and it was successful. He was loyal to his dog :,( such an amazing movie, they sure don't make movies like they used to, i'm so sick of CGi and I yearn for the days of practicality in films. the real influnce behind fallout , from the vaults to super mutants , its all there . omg i must watch it That ending! Thank you for making this theay made a fallout movie best on theas ? the 80s was a heyday for post apocolyptic films Now I know where they got the idea for the Fallout series. Great trailer. Didn't reveal the key parts of the movie. That's a rarity nowadays. Shallow b/c I didn't like a movie..and you call me shallow. Wow. You're shallow person... I guess I'm just too spoiled by technology and special effects. Didn't like it. it's a shame that this film is so rare and costly to buy Thanks so much! I'm glad it lived up to your expectations! Yeah, it has to be one of the greatest ending ever. You're very welcome! Thanks a ton for your comments. Well, you did it justice! Found the movie on Netflix and loved it. Especially the ending. Thanks again! Thanks! Haha I suppose that's a pretty great compliment. Though I actually do like this movie that much. Yup, another trailer that doesn't do the movie justice. Thanks so much! I'm honored that this made you want to watch it. That is, after all, the point! I totally agree about the original trailer, it frustrated me so much that I made this one to fix it.
Breakheart Pass 	one of the very best charles Bronson movie . not far from once upon a time A classic and thrilling western that is often forgotten about. I love this movie. Love everything about it - the story, the characters, the actors, the action, the music, the directing... everything! ok with sean great movie 70 s Bronson unforgatable moments great  film
Breakout 	Just watched it. It was surprisingly good For comfort Kenny Baxter escapes into the world of comic books especially when Tommy Baxter breaks out the infamous "green hat" Worth watching for Brendan Fraser's forest tracking technique. Think an emotional Sasquatch with a wooden leg and a gun. JUST How did he end up in these terrible movies... :( So cliche to bring this after Prison Break. What were they even thinking? brendan is my mom's favorit actor.....love him. Ok, so I love Brendan Fraser as an actor. I know that a lot of people aren't a fan of his acting but i think he is really good. I have so far enjoyed every single one of his movies - even if other people don't (i.e. Hustlers, Dudley Do Right). But why the hell is his acting soooooo bad in this movie? I understand that this film has a low budget and has so many mistakes (infinite ammo in each gun, hopping in a canoe in an open river whilst getting shot at). This is an awful movie, everything is bad. The weird thing is that other movie's he filmed in the same year had good performances. I'm stumped. when you see Dominic Purcell and Brendan Fraser in a movie you know not to even bother watching im watching this movie right now . got up to 74 minutes. I cant take it anymore. very bad movie Dz funny...george of the jungle..haha!!!! jon doe!!!! one of the worst movies i've ever seen river wild rip off? thanks dude. you just saved me from 2 hours of a shitty movie. (although the trailer already did half your job) well played, sir AWESOME MOVIE thanks for the spoiler fucknut thnx no need to watch the movie now
Bucktown Carl 	Weathers who was in Bucktown was also in Action Jackson movie with Sharon Stone, Craig T Nelson and Vanity. I love Vanity and she was hot back in the day. I got Action Jackson on dvd. I also liked Carl in Rocky 1,2,3,4 movies with Sylvester Stallone. It's sad he got killed by Dolph Lundgren in part 4. Rocknrollfan, I agree and I got Bucktown on dvd. Thalmus Rasulala and Pam Grier were also in Steven Seagal and Sharon Stone's Above The Law movie I got on dvd. I love it and Steven is my favorite action movie star. I got several of his movies on dvd. I put pictures of Pam Grier, Steven Seagal and Sharon Stone on my Facebook page. This is the film that I'm looking for! Better than Friday foster and better than sheba,baby! I was laughing when Fred Williamson killed Tony King hahahahahahahahahahaha. I also laughed when Fred beat Tony up at his house when he was about to rape Pam Grier and he didn't know that Fred was home with her. Acroberts25, Thalmus Rasulala was your grandfather huh? Sorry to hear he died. He was a good actor. I saw him in New Jack City with Wesley Snipes, Allen Payne, Ice T, Chris Rock, Mario Van Peebles. He was Mario's police boss. That movie came out in 1991 and he died the same year. Wow. I love Bucktown and i love Pam Grier. She was so hot back in the day. I can't stand Tony King. He's always beating on women in every movie he's in LOL. He beat up Lonette McKee in Sparkle. LOL@Carl Weathers had on some red pants when he got killed by Fred Williamson hahahahahahahahahahaha. I like the scene when Pam and Thalmus are having a argument when Thalmus tried to get into his car. Thalmus said to her, you show me somebody who cares about somebody and i'll show you a fool LOL. He said you think anybody in this town cares about who gets killed? He said the only thing people care about is the big g, green money LOL. Hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowing hahahahahahahahahaha. I watched this movie.... Good movie.... I highly recommend it.What's happening now in Ferguson Missouri made me think of this film, Bucktown. iam watching it right now the brothers are. running the town. and staring THALMUS  RA SU LALALALALALALALALALALALALA? Born in 1994 I loved this movie so I decided to name my mixtape Bucktown Balladz That Black Moon track is ringing in my head now. Just turned 18 last month this is one of my favorite movies, so i chose to name it after my mixtape and use this video as the trailer. I love pam grier  omg she was so sexy  bck in the days if she was still young I wud do  her  anytyme His great works will live on!  I thought Thalmus Rasulala  was Tracey Morgans father Fred Williamson is one guy who knows how to use a cue stick!  SNAP!   Carl Weathers is in this too! GOOD MOVIE! Saw this movie on MGM the other day - great fun!!!
Capone 	slab film How many times do they have to say "Al Capone"?A lot, I gather because Gazzara is woefully miscast and nobody believes he's Al Capone. *Where the fuck was Stallone?* CAP1 Bob Hoskins will be a great Capone 0:59   He sounds like Al Pacino. Heavens to the Great Gatsby! THANKS for posting this exciting clip!  I had never even heard of this mid-70's gangster flick until recently watching it on the Fox Movie Channel.  The acting isn't too good...it has a low budget look to it...but it's never boring (the sex & violence are practically non-stop).  Cutie pie Susan Blakely was certainly one hot babe in her day!  Strictly from hubbahubbaville, daddy-o!  CHEERS! :)
Carry on Behind 	My favorite carry on movie,the only one i own Terrible Carry-on film. One of the worst. Funniest  Line we had a good bang together ! RIP Kenneth Williams so much missed xx I'm surprised that none of the Carry on Series or The Confession's Series (Confession's of a window cleaner,Confession of a taxi driver,etc) never won any awards for best films of the year.I heard they were real blockbuster films in the 1970's. Strangely ironic but the 2 raving gays never as far as I recall played gays only straight womanisers in any Carry on films, The Gays were only ever straight actors, Both Charles Hawtrey and Kenneth Williams at a time being Gay was against the law in UK.... Maybe that's the reason... Doh! Carry on behind is funny and the last acceptable carry on film england and emmanuel was absolute SHITTT! Carry on movies are my favourite i got them all I am having a dirty caravan and looking for birds. ! Ha The last great Carry On film, I really like it!  and up yours Love Kenneths talk over the image of the stripper. love this love the lines I am ...em..how you say sorry my English I am keeping dirty caravan .....i have birds in caravan ... .. great filmo for one of the later ones this was quite funny - windsor davies vgd oh my goodness i loved it, it was hililious My favourite Carry On film and ...Carol Hawkins......phew!!!!!!!!! @morgansifer82- agreed me balls burning-dont stand so close to the fire! hahahahahaha! this carry on film has some good bits, however it misses the presence of Sid James and Charles Hawtrey.
Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold Stella 	is the best thing in this movie como hag0 quiero la pelicula completo alguien pudiera ayudarme hmmmm.... cool
Confessions of a Pop Performer 	It's actually a funny film, but you wouldn't know that from this trailer. have you seen my  ]] awful yet hilarious - including the bit where a woman says 'sock it to me' and gets punched in the face.were it not for the sex I would have loved this as a 10 year old. Interesting to see a alternate "clothed" shot in this trailer... Gill Gascoine nude oo la la I'm going to try to get this, somehow..Thanks ; )
Cooley High "Aww baby you make my heart BLEED for ya!"  	LOL who do you guys think is more attractive Cochise or preach lol They finessed they asses lol "You bitches are under arrest." Banned language today. "MOVE IT BITCH!!!" LMAO Wtf u going to do with 50 cent these days now? lol Wtf u going to do with 50 cent? lol it's kind of like how I grew up but in a different time and in a different state in a different age they were in Chicago in the 1960s and I was in Lakeland Florida in 1980s. wait a minute The Lone Ranger this Part was funny as hell you see how. hoes use to. dress. them days yoy had to ask was they hoes back then lol 15 dollars. shit now. days they want 50 and higher. you see how. hoes use to. dress. them days yoy had to ask was they hoes back then lol 15 dollars. shit now. days they want 50 and higher. you see how. hoes use to. dress. them days yoy had to ask was they hoes back then lol 15 dollars. shit now. days they want 50 and higher.

Cornbread, Earl and Me 	I always thought Fishbourne's first movie was "Apocalypse Now" when he was 17 years old.Like someone before said, he looks the same, just like a mini-Larry. LOL!It is all in the eyes for him. Back when Laurence fishburne was a Nigglet lol TEAM 5150 MOTHA FUCKAS he died in the movie Laurence Fishburne looks the same... just little :) Lambda lambda killed cornbread I saw this movie at the Fox Theatre in St. Louis along with Cooley High back in the seventies. Back when you pay a dollar to see 2-3 movies. Man! This movie's got everybody in it. Jamaal Wilkes, back when he went by Keith Wilkes. They just don't make movies like this anymore. Love this film Love this flick! He loves soda pop! You woulda thought they killed cornbread.
Cousin cousine 	WAS THIS DISTRIBUTED BY THE SAME FILM COMPANY THAT DISTRIBUTED THE OLD HORROR FILM PIECES? What is the name of the sexy romantic song that they dance to at the end of the film?
The Deadly Tower 	The day "Agent Zero M" went Colonel Kurtz and became Snake Pliskin. Pre-Steadicam tracking shot! I first saw this movie when I was a young adult. It scared me so badly I didn't want to go out in public for a long time. (I did of course) It seemed to me to be such a foreign concept, mass murder. Nowadays it's happening every week and doesn't seem to faze us (me) like it used to . So sad, that.
Death Be Not Proud Recognition by the Other... 	Grabs you right at the heart... and rare...oh so rare...
The Death Collector 	better quality than the dvd one of all-time favorites He was the one of the best actors in the world. Joe pesci.The short giant man.
Death Race 2000 	Event death race 2000 scare to put volvo on race Rated R!!!!   hahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Wacky Races Well our 2000 sucked compared to theirs 0:05 Joe pesci? holy grindhouse! I need to see this movie!!! I think quentin tarantino took inspiration from the legend that is Roger corman Reminds me of twisted metal. i do not watched the movie, but this trailer reminded me old PC game - carmageddon (little a bit). Race, cars like in a game and killing people So the R rated version of Wacky Races then haha year 2014:P Better than the shitty remake. LOL same as Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage game. Of course, it was yet another entry into the arena of the "dystopian society" films. So escapist & best viewed on mary jane or what ev your preference is. Midnight movie? fer sur  Drive-In flick? fer sur  Cult film? way fer sur.   Another cool, escapist drive-in movie. Weren't these fun?  I love the drawing background at the beginning.
The Devil's Rain 	My Dad brought me to see this flick in Brooklyn when I when I was six-years old Back when Hollywood had no problems spooking the kids with these creepy as crap trailers... :O Cheesy 70's devilry. Love it. Makes this Satanist proud!! Ernest Borgnine as the horned devil. Planet of The Apes meets The Devil's Rain! whats with that dudes face melting? urgh.. this movie many secene melting.. I remember when Siskel & Ebert had their PBS show they used to do segment called "Dog of the week" where they picked the week's worst movie and one week they chose this because it was being advertised in some cities as "starring John Travolta" and he's in this for about 1/2 a second and looks like he fell asleep on a pizza at the end. literally the movie in a nutshell and what the F... was Anton Lavey doing here, in this movie, I suppose, it was hard in that time for his followers to take him seriously Thanks, now I know how it ends is it just me or was the trailer way too revealing Saw this at the drive-in as a kid but don't remember much about it. ..also saw Race With The Devil and to this day i STILL like the flick. actually a pretty sick trailer i saw this when I was little and damn near needed therapy..... Back in the 80's, on Easter Sunday, no less, I was channel surfing while ma was baking a ham. The parade? Who cares. Wizard of Oz? Seen it. Lo and behold, on a syndicate channel, I caught this gem of cinematic brilliants. Pretty tacky timing, to say the least.
Diamonds 	What is the red car. Is it a caddy sad! first!!
Doc Savage Merci 	When slithering horror threatens... TOIIIINNNNGGGG ! Imagine calling a woman a prick! It doesn't quite work some how...Looool *Can see where Donald Trump gets his inspiration from.* What is Doc Savage? Is he a gov agent? This was a really fun movie, but it never went anywhere. It's the perfect case of needing a good reboot. That eye twinkle! Pure awesomeness. Starring a young Donald Trump! I loved Ron Ely but he couldn't act. I actually bought this on VHS because I missed it in 75. I loved the Bantam books & Marvel's version. This movie was so bad it was unwatchable. I gave it to a hardcore Doc Savage fan. He threw it in the trash after trying to watch this piece of shit! Now the new movie sounds like another train wreck with the ROCK> WTF are these producers on crack? I need to see this!!!! Gosh is this really getting a reboot?Gonna be worse than the ghostbusters. Voice over:''When you're about to die in a horrible death''Actor:''We are all gonna die-pause for dramatic effect- in a horrible death.'' xD Was this suppose to be a comedy? It's Official guys and girls!! Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is playing Doc Savage!! WHITE SUITS WITH WIDE, POINTY BROWN LAPELS ARE *NEVER* OUT OF FASHION. *NEVER* a contemptible waste of time.  All those people waiting for decades for the first Doc Savage film and THIS is what they get??? Doc Savage is a DON! A beautiful babe is throwing it at you and declares her love for you...what do you say, Doc? 'Mona...you're a brick!' Class!!! The late Mark Lenard a.k.a. Sarek did the voice-over. We need Doc Savage in the 21st Century!!  Really need a re-boot of this movie~!

Dolemite 	A lot of people say the Human Tornado is better than Dolemite. I don't see it, yes it has a bigger budget and the woman look better(although there is one tranny who some guy's may find attractive, I don't). That's all that movie has going for it, Dolemite is more LOL funny to me! Came here because of Ol' Dirty. dolemiteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! buick electra 225! Did someone film this trailer and timetravel to put it in the 70's? Cause I dont believe this was real thing. BLOOP BLACK CRACK SMACK BUDACK ATTACK DONT BE FUCKIN WITH DOLOMITE scene at 0:45 is just too hilarious i cant stop re-watching it hwhahahah this motherfucker got rhythm Hilarious choreography! This trailer doesn't even touch on Dolemite's rap about the sinking of the Titanic. No joke - this is a scene which actually happens.An unforgettable movie. That trailer was more enjoyable than most movies dolemite mothey fhokeh best movie trailer ever Wait so is this a comedy?It just looks terrible... I know that most of the cast consisted of comedians but they all look so serious. they should do a remake of Dolemite!!! Snoop Dogg as Dolemite and Nick Cannon as Willy Green "And tell him I want him out of here in 24 hours... And 23 of 'em already gone." LOL he's like Shaft's retarded twin brother R.i.p "Dolemite is a 1975 blaxploitation feature film, and is also the name of its principal character, played by Rudy Ray Moore, who co-wrote the film and its soundtrack. Moore, who started his career as a stand-up comedian in the late 1960s, heard around that time a rhymed toast by a local homeless man about an urban hero named Dolemite, and decided to adopt the persona of Dolemite as an alter ego in his act."-Wikipedia "Way down in the jungle, deep!"
The Drowning Pool 	Please Bring back Young Justice, but not like you did to Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go ruined the memory of Teen Titans.
The Eiger Sanction 	Really good film.Terrible but unintentionally-hilarious trailer! currently reading this now,enjoying every page of it. George Kennedy and Jack Cassidy were great in this (RIP). Great underrated movie. Clint actually reminds me of Jim Carrey's snappy comebacks.
Eric 	great film great message. if the good guys stick together we can defeat the bad guys. immense movie @lukigolberth thanks a lot :) @LennartPaulsen Mike Schmid-Today I'm ok  :) song name of the last part pls?awesome movie <3ovies His best film I feel. the only period film that compares with and rivals it is Ridleys Scott THE DUELLISTS (1977).A million times better that that overrated piece of rubbish DANGEROUS LIASONS.This is what a period film should be. Theres just something about Kubrick's films that just haunts me till this date. Every movie I've seen since I was little and after multiple viewing just stays with me. "Director Stanley Kubrick asserts a claim to greatness that time alone can, and probably will, confirm."You have no idea This trailer is full of spoiler! haha What I remember when this movie came out was that everybody hated it.  My guess is they made the trailer this way to cherry-pick all the good reviews because there were so many bad ones.  I myself liked it a lot but didn't loved it.  While the costume design, sets, artistic design, cinematography and music were all amazing, the story was deemed cold and emotionless, and Ryan O'Neal's character was thought unlikeable.  For me, it was a valuable and impeccable history lesson for an era of Europe I never liked. All of these comments are ignorant! Does anyone have anything to say about how beautiful this film Mr. Kubrick created?Who cares about high definition or any of these narrow minded comments. Today's society will never understand how beautiful this piece of work is. So sad that attention spans today are less than 4.7 seconds!Our race is on the downside. someone needs to learn the definition of HD the parents of west indies cricketer Ryan Hinds gave him the middle name of "O'Neal" because of how fond they were of the 70s movie superstar. Happy 40th Anniversary to Barry Lyndon!
Best Friends 	CHARLES LEE RAY IT'S ALIVE!!!! (chuky) When is this coming out I wanna see it!! I can't wait for Nostalgia Critic to review this in a couple of years. I can't wait for Nostalgia Critic to review this in a couple of years. "I'm in the gold business", is that like being "in the computer business"? Tommy Wiseau is a gift from god, he is an angel. Oh hi mark If this movie doesn't have Tommy saying "You're tearing me apart Lisa!" at least once, I'll be very disappointed. looks fucking great "Who are you?""We are going to my paradise." I did not WHYYYYY LIZZA...WHYYYYYY. "what a great party and you invited all of my friends good thinking." You can trust me. Come on guy.Yup, I'm definitely getting in that hearse. Oh hi mark.... In a minute bitch... Don't touch me muddafuckerrr!!!! You're tearing me apart Lisa! 0:21 - this trailer doesn't look that good, but this line... this sign Greg is holding, this is my favorite movie quote of all times now. Just genius. I honestly can't wait for this movie
Beyond the Bermuda Triangle 	So when does Donna Mills take off her top? The movie basically good.... available on DVD.....campy as it is,the stories of disappearances ARE TRUE. At 17:44 discussion was made about the freighter "Marine Sulphur Queen" and how it disappeared without a trace. Not entirely true. Wreckage including a life preserver and a board with part of the ship's name had washed up on shore. The board with the ship's name was blackened on the reverse side, leaving experts to believe the ship had exploded. good movie seen it about 3 times... Remember Movie, good memories. Love DonnaMills I don't remember the title of a TV movie.  It is where a group of friends are on this yacht in the middle of the ocean treasure hunting.  They found chest with an idol in it.  Who ever gets close to it is possess and controlled by it...that is all I remember. old oakland. Fred's second to last film appearance. Nice job. Miss you Fred. I wanna eat Donna Mills' pussy THANKS... a lot! locked.....nice..beyond...movie... Pretty good movie. I first saw it about 40 years ago on tv on a late night movie. Hey you know the best part in this movie was , The boring ending, thank god I skipped through it in the first 9 min.s of the movie . Well that's 9 min.s I won't get back of my life ! keep shareing classic movies......Thx Nostalgic, campy, past era reminiscent, really brings me back to the 1970's .  Thanks for the upload. This movie is about my life Lol Bell bottom pants. The sun comes up in the east and goes down in the west; question is why don't the plane pilot go toward the sun off the east coast due west... ?? Strange
Bite the Bullet 	I salute you Sir...you did a great job with one of my all-time FAVES !  I can recite this film, WORD FOR WORD ! This, The Shootist, The Cowboys, and Pat Garret are the best westerns before Unforgiven ( and still just as good) This is awesome well done GREAT job, filmbuff. Not widely known or recognized but one of my faves. Lots of stars and the age old story of two pals getting old & not knowing it or acting like it. AAAAA!! My sister and I had to sit through this in 1976 or so just to see "Tommy".  It was a double feature, and my mom made us see both. My sister probably liked it more than I did because of the horses. I saw the movie which was a Japanese-dubbed version on TV. film avvincente ed istruttivo in cui si dimostra che gli umani, per quanto siano capaci, motivati, solidali o competitivi, non sono migliori dei cavalli, loro strumenti e vittime
The Black Bird 	Just finished watching this movie it's such a cute movie with a great ending We are truly living in the last days this world is getting dirty and dingy every day sad but so true. People keep complaining about the religion, but the point of this movie was to show the struggle between homosexuality and religion. My friend went through this same stage and it hurt them a lot. I went through it as well when I was trying to figure out why I didn't have sexual desires because I was called a freak. Just because you are gay, doesn't mean you can't be religious. That's what the movie was showing. Also, the movie also symbolizes accepting yourself and moving on. You saw this when the main character accepted themselves and then (SPOILER ALERT) their sister came home. This movie showed what it's like to be religious and to be gay. I felt very uncomfortable at times.... but it was ok Wowww these comments are interesting were in a different time mane it's not the end of the fuckin world he'll you really wonna get technical half the population of human race are gay and or bisexual smdh most of these actors directors etc are gay it's not a death sentence my god that's one of our many problems we face in this world somebody always in the background judging or making ill comments on ones sexuality or preference I mean errrybody is entitled to ones own opinion and yes ignorance is still bliss in 2016 but cry me a river it's not even that serious in todays generation and I agree the whole aspect of this young man praying to what they persevere to be a white jesus threw me off and as far as this foolishness of being gay is a choice well I don't know it all depends on how you look at it cause at the end of the day no matter what the situation we all have a choice in everything we do so I don't disagree with you there but all this foolishness about one going to hell behind ones sexuality is crazy that were the case half the population of human race would be in this place you call hell  no I wouldn't want my future son to go there the battles one would faces as a gay man but you  can't choice witch direction your child goes pertaining to ones sexuality with todays generation it's best to keep an open mind even if you don't agree with ones lifestyle period it's all about ones perspective.... when i watched this trailer i didn't spot the white dude who was actually a big influence in the whole story. xD good trailer! 1:28 that girl is fucking beautiful, damn that short hair! <3<3 Eddy Long approved this movie. it was so cute,and good also cool. Time are changing  is going to be a piece full life. I'm literally just now finding out about this movie! I wanna see it!! This movies was Garbage asf Why put religion in movies about us gays ? Like that shit getting dead lmao The  book is different.  Loved the movie all the same. This movie is great. I was hesitant and skeptical to watch it, but I'm glad I took this Sunday evening to. It's definitely in my top five for gay films. It has definitely change the future me, especially how I would be a father, if by small chance I become one. Great Movie! Cried a couple of times! God Loves all of us! I just got done from watching this movie on Netflix and I gotta say,its a sad but great movie that I recommend people should watch!
Black Moon 	Downloadby Rodrigo/Cariocahttp://cariocabaixeaqui.blogspot.com worst trailer of all time Aha this is the French original. There are also an American version from 1986. I hate these trailers that have to tell you ever plot point in the movie, thereby ruining the film! If you thought the trailer was riveting, wait till you sit through the whole movie. 0:42 the director should cut this scene faster. BLACK MOON should come out on Black-Ray. lovely motonymphWhat is wrong with you? They didn't kill that animal, don't you know about special effects? That is the art of filmmaking creating an illusion making look the impossible possible. They don't hurt any animals in here.  that is one wild trailer To motonymph's point, if this had been a true on-screen killing of an animal, the film would be a degenerate piece of filth and not art. There were indeed mainstream movies from the past century depicting such acts, and there is no historical or artistic context with which to reasonably justify them. @motonymph hahaha, you idiot! Cow, pig, chicken... every day killing. I'm really mad that I just watched that trailer and all I saw was a badger get run over. It's funny how some people don't notice the cut-away at 0:42 Because of the clearly abrupt cut and change of camera angle at the moment of impact- your care for animals is admirable, though! :) badger badger badger badger badger SPLAT badger badger
Boss Nigger 	The pre-election video of Barack Obama is "Boss Nigger trailer" Back when SJWs didn't exist id watch it looks funny with lots of action. America is great! Beasley from the URL sound just like the narrator. Boss Nigger! They were going to make a sequel with him in Medieval England and call it "Sir Nigger" DAMN IT ENGINEER, AGAIN?! A modern day reboot would be called Boss N-Word. can somebody please remake this It's as if _Blazing Saddles_ and _Dolemite_ had an illegitimate child together...and it's beautiful. :) Is it wrong to be a honky and love the trailer? RATED PG That chrome mare's leg, though. Pretty sweet signature weapon. I got into trouble once singing the song off of this by mistake I like how he emphasized "Fred Williamson IS boss nigger". Kinda changes the meaning of the sentence. WSTHH brought me here!!! Ouuuh wee Blacksploitation at its FINEST!!!! Loving this gem!! white woman got kissed by a NIGGER BOSS NIGGER now they need to make a QUEER ATHEIST MOVIE Thumbs up if you're watching the trailer because of the title. This may be the single funniest video I've ever seen.....
A Boy and His Dog 	I'm glad this trailer existed, I used this as a presentation for a class and it was successful. He was loyal to his dog :,( such an amazing movie, they sure don't make movies like they used to, i'm so sick of CGi and I yearn for the days of practicality in films. the real influnce behind fallout , from the vaults to super mutants , its all there . omg i must watch it That ending! Thank you for making this theay made a fallout movie best on theas ? the 80s was a heyday for post apocolyptic films Now I know where they got the idea for the Fallout series. Great trailer. Didn't reveal the key parts of the movie. That's a rarity nowadays. Shallow b/c I didn't like a movie..and you call me shallow. Wow. You're shallow person... I guess I'm just too spoiled by technology and special effects. Didn't like it. it's a shame that this film is so rare and costly to buy Thanks so much! I'm glad it lived up to your expectations! Yeah, it has to be one of the greatest ending ever. You're very welcome! Thanks a ton for your comments. Well, you did it justice! Found the movie on Netflix and loved it. Especially the ending. Thanks again! Thanks! Haha I suppose that's a pretty great compliment. Though I actually do like this movie that much. Yup, another trailer that doesn't do the movie justice. Thanks so much! I'm honored that this made you want to watch it. That is, after all, the point! I totally agree about the original trailer, it frustrated me so much that I made this one to fix it.
Breakheart Pass 	one of the very best charles Bronson movie . not far from once upon a time A classic and thrilling western that is often forgotten about. I love this movie. Love everything about it - the story, the characters, the actors, the action, the music, the directing... everything! ok with sean great movie 70 s Bronson unforgatable moments great  film
Breakout 	Just watched it. It was surprisingly good For comfort Kenny Baxter escapes into the world of comic books especially when Tommy Baxter breaks out the infamous "green hat" Worth watching for Brendan Fraser's forest tracking technique. Think an emotional Sasquatch with a wooden leg and a gun. JUST How did he end up in these terrible movies... :( So cliche to bring this after Prison Break. What were they even thinking? brendan is my mom's favorit actor.....love him. Ok, so I love Brendan Fraser as an actor. I know that a lot of people aren't a fan of his acting but i think he is really good. I have so far enjoyed every single one of his movies - even if other people don't (i.e. Hustlers, Dudley Do Right). But why the hell is his acting soooooo bad in this movie? I understand that this film has a low budget and has so many mistakes (infinite ammo in each gun, hopping in a canoe in an open river whilst getting shot at). This is an awful movie, everything is bad. The weird thing is that other movie's he filmed in the same year had good performances. I'm stumped. when you see Dominic Purcell and Brendan Fraser in a movie you know not to even bother watching im watching this movie right now . got up to 74 minutes. I cant take it anymore. very bad movie Dz funny...george of the jungle..haha!!!! jon doe!!!! one of the worst movies i've ever seen river wild rip off? thanks dude. you just saved me from 2 hours of a shitty movie. (although the trailer already did half your job) well played, sir AWESOME MOVIE thanks for the spoiler fucknut thnx no need to watch the movie now
Bucktown Carl 	Weathers who was in Bucktown was also in Action Jackson movie with Sharon Stone, Craig T Nelson and Vanity. I love Vanity and she was hot back in the day. I got Action Jackson on dvd. I also liked Carl in Rocky 1,2,3,4 movies with Sylvester Stallone. It's sad he got killed by Dolph Lundgren in part 4. Rocknrollfan, I agree and I got Bucktown on dvd. Thalmus Rasulala and Pam Grier were also in Steven Seagal and Sharon Stone's Above The Law movie I got on dvd. I love it and Steven is my favorite action movie star. I got several of his movies on dvd. I put pictures of Pam Grier, Steven Seagal and Sharon Stone on my Facebook page. This is the film that I'm looking for! Better than Friday foster and better than sheba,baby! I was laughing when Fred Williamson killed Tony King hahahahahahahahahahaha. I also laughed when Fred beat Tony up at his house when he was about to rape Pam Grier and he didn't know that Fred was home with her. Acroberts25, Thalmus Rasulala was your grandfather huh? Sorry to hear he died. He was a good actor. I saw him in New Jack City with Wesley Snipes, Allen Payne, Ice T, Chris Rock, Mario Van Peebles. He was Mario's police boss. That movie came out in 1991 and he died the same year. Wow. I love Bucktown and i love Pam Grier. She was so hot back in the day. I can't stand Tony King. He's always beating on women in every movie he's in LOL. He beat up Lonette McKee in Sparkle. LOL@Carl Weathers had on some red pants when he got killed by Fred Williamson hahahahahahahahahahaha. I like the scene when Pam and Thalmus are having a argument when Thalmus tried to get into his car. Thalmus said to her, you show me somebody who cares about somebody and i'll show you a fool LOL. He said you think anybody in this town cares about who gets killed? He said the only thing people care about is the big g, green money LOL. Hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowing hahahahahahahahahaha. I watched this movie.... Good movie.... I highly recommend it.What's happening now in Ferguson Missouri made me think of this film, Bucktown. iam watching it right now the brothers are. running the town. and staring THALMUS  RA SU LALALALALALALALALALALALALA? Born in 1994 I loved this movie so I decided to name my mixtape Bucktown Balladz That Black Moon track is ringing in my head now. Just turned 18 last month this is one of my favorite movies, so i chose to name it after my mixtape and use this video as the trailer. I love pam grier  omg she was so sexy  bck in the days if she was still young I wud do  her  anytyme His great works will live on!  I thought Thalmus Rasulala  was Tracey Morgans father Fred Williamson is one guy who knows how to use a cue stick!  SNAP!   Carl Weathers is in this too! GOOD MOVIE! Saw this movie on MGM the other day - great fun!!!
Capone 	slab film How many times do they have to say "Al Capone"?A lot, I gather because Gazzara is woefully miscast and nobody believes he's Al Capone. *Where the fuck was Stallone?* CAP1 Bob Hoskins will be a great Capone 0:59   He sounds like Al Pacino. Heavens to the Great Gatsby! THANKS for posting this exciting clip!  I had never even heard of this mid-70's gangster flick until recently watching it on the Fox Movie Channel.  The acting isn't too good...it has a low budget look to it...but it's never boring (the sex & violence are practically non-stop).  Cutie pie Susan Blakely was certainly one hot babe in her day!  Strictly from hubbahubbaville, daddy-o!  CHEERS! :)
Carry on Behind 	My favorite carry on movie,the only one i own Terrible Carry-on film. One of the worst. Funniest  Line we had a good bang together ! RIP Kenneth Williams so much missed xx I'm surprised that none of the Carry on Series or The Confession's Series (Confession's of a window cleaner,Confession of a taxi driver,etc) never won any awards for best films of the year.I heard they were real blockbuster films in the 1970's. Strangely ironic but the 2 raving gays never as far as I recall played gays only straight womanisers in any Carry on films, The Gays were only ever straight actors, Both Charles Hawtrey and Kenneth Williams at a time being Gay was against the law in UK.... Maybe that's the reason... Doh! Carry on behind is funny and the last acceptable carry on film england and emmanuel was absolute SHITTT! Carry on movies are my favourite i got them all I am having a dirty caravan and looking for birds. ! Ha The last great Carry On film, I really like it!  and up yours Love Kenneths talk over the image of the stripper. love this love the lines I am ...em..how you say sorry my English I am keeping dirty caravan .....i have birds in caravan ... .. great filmo for one of the later ones this was quite funny - windsor davies vgd oh my goodness i loved it, it was hililious My favourite Carry On film and ...Carol Hawkins......phew!!!!!!!!! @morgansifer82- agreed me balls burning-dont stand so close to the fire! hahahahahaha! this carry on film has some good bits, however it misses the presence of Sid James and Charles Hawtrey.
Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold Stella 	is the best thing in this movie como hag0 quiero la pelicula completo alguien pudiera ayudarme hmmmm.... cool
Confessions of a Pop Performer 	It's actually a funny film, but you wouldn't know that from this trailer. have you seen my  ]] awful yet hilarious - including the bit where a woman says 'sock it to me' and gets punched in the face.were it not for the sex I would have loved this as a 10 year old. Interesting to see a alternate "clothed" shot in this trailer... Gill Gascoine nude oo la la I'm going to try to get this, somehow..Thanks ; )
Cooley High "Aww baby you make my heart BLEED for ya!"  	LOL who do you guys think is more attractive Cochise or preach lol They finessed they asses lol "You bitches are under arrest." Banned language today. "MOVE IT BITCH!!!" LMAO Wtf u going to do with 50 cent these days now? lol Wtf u going to do with 50 cent? lol it's kind of like how I grew up but in a different time and in a different state in a different age they were in Chicago in the 1960s and I was in Lakeland Florida in 1980s. wait a minute The Lone Ranger this Part was funny as hell you see how. hoes use to. dress. them days yoy had to ask was they hoes back then lol 15 dollars. shit now. days they want 50 and higher. you see how. hoes use to. dress. them days yoy had to ask was they hoes back then lol 15 dollars. shit now. days they want 50 and higher. you see how. hoes use to. dress. them days yoy had to ask was they hoes back then lol 15 dollars. shit now. days they want 50 and higher.

Cornbread, Earl and Me 	I always thought Fishbourne's first movie was "Apocalypse Now" when he was 17 years old.Like someone before said, he looks the same, just like a mini-Larry. LOL!It is all in the eyes for him. Back when Laurence fishburne was a Nigglet lol TEAM 5150 MOTHA FUCKAS he died in the movie Laurence Fishburne looks the same... just little :) Lambda lambda killed cornbread I saw this movie at the Fox Theatre in St. Louis along with Cooley High back in the seventies. Back when you pay a dollar to see 2-3 movies. Man! This movie's got everybody in it. Jamaal Wilkes, back when he went by Keith Wilkes. They just don't make movies like this anymore. Love this film Love this flick! He loves soda pop! You woulda thought they killed cornbread.
Cousin cousine 	WAS THIS DISTRIBUTED BY THE SAME FILM COMPANY THAT DISTRIBUTED THE OLD HORROR FILM PIECES? What is the name of the sexy romantic song that they dance to at the end of the film?
The Deadly Tower 	The day "Agent Zero M" went Colonel Kurtz and became Snake Pliskin. Pre-Steadicam tracking shot! I first saw this movie when I was a young adult. It scared me so badly I didn't want to go out in public for a long time. (I did of course) It seemed to me to be such a foreign concept, mass murder. Nowadays it's happening every week and doesn't seem to faze us (me) like it used to . So sad, that.
Death Be Not Proud Recognition by the Other... 	Grabs you right at the heart... and rare...oh so rare...
The Death Collector 	better quality than the dvd one of all-time favorites He was the one of the best actors in the world. Joe pesci.The short giant man.
Death Race 2000 	Event death race 2000 scare to put volvo on race Rated R!!!!   hahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Wacky Races Well our 2000 sucked compared to theirs 0:05 Joe pesci? holy grindhouse! I need to see this movie!!! I think quentin tarantino took inspiration from the legend that is Roger corman Reminds me of twisted metal. i do not watched the movie, but this trailer reminded me old PC game - carmageddon (little a bit). Race, cars like in a game and killing people So the R rated version of Wacky Races then haha year 2014:P Better than the shitty remake. LOL same as Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage game. Of course, it was yet another entry into the arena of the "dystopian society" films. So escapist & best viewed on mary jane or what ev your preference is. Midnight movie? fer sur  Drive-In flick? fer sur  Cult film? way fer sur.   Another cool, escapist drive-in movie. Weren't these fun?  I love the drawing background at the beginning.
The Devil's Rain 	My Dad brought me to see this flick in Brooklyn when I when I was six-years old Back when Hollywood had no problems spooking the kids with these creepy as crap trailers... :O Cheesy 70's devilry. Love it. Makes this Satanist proud!! Ernest Borgnine as the horned devil. Planet of The Apes meets The Devil's Rain! whats with that dudes face melting? urgh.. this movie many secene melting.. I remember when Siskel & Ebert had their PBS show they used to do segment called "Dog of the week" where they picked the week's worst movie and one week they chose this because it was being advertised in some cities as "starring John Travolta" and he's in this for about 1/2 a second and looks like he fell asleep on a pizza at the end. literally the movie in a nutshell and what the F... was Anton Lavey doing here, in this movie, I suppose, it was hard in that time for his followers to take him seriously Thanks, now I know how it ends is it just me or was the trailer way too revealing Saw this at the drive-in as a kid but don't remember much about it. ..also saw Race With The Devil and to this day i STILL like the flick. actually a pretty sick trailer i saw this when I was little and damn near needed therapy..... Back in the 80's, on Easter Sunday, no less, I was channel surfing while ma was baking a ham. The parade? Who cares. Wizard of Oz? Seen it. Lo and behold, on a syndicate channel, I caught this gem of cinematic brilliants. Pretty tacky timing, to say the least.
Diamonds 	What is the red car. Is it a caddy sad! first!!
Doc Savage Merci 	When slithering horror threatens... TOIIIINNNNGGGG ! Imagine calling a woman a prick! It doesn't quite work some how...Looool *Can see where Donald Trump gets his inspiration from.* What is Doc Savage? Is he a gov agent? This was a really fun movie, but it never went anywhere. It's the perfect case of needing a good reboot. That eye twinkle! Pure awesomeness. Starring a young Donald Trump! I loved Ron Ely but he couldn't act. I actually bought this on VHS because I missed it in 75. I loved the Bantam books & Marvel's version. This movie was so bad it was unwatchable. I gave it to a hardcore Doc Savage fan. He threw it in the trash after trying to watch this piece of shit! Now the new movie sounds like another train wreck with the ROCK> WTF are these producers on crack? I need to see this!!!! Gosh is this really getting a reboot?Gonna be worse than the ghostbusters. Voice over:''When you're about to die in a horrible death''Actor:''We are all gonna die-pause for dramatic effect- in a horrible death.'' xD Was this suppose to be a comedy? It's Official guys and girls!! Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is playing Doc Savage!! WHITE SUITS WITH WIDE, POINTY BROWN LAPELS ARE *NEVER* OUT OF FASHION. *NEVER* a contemptible waste of time.  All those people waiting for decades for the first Doc Savage film and THIS is what they get??? Doc Savage is a DON! A beautiful babe is throwing it at you and declares her love for you...what do you say, Doc? 'Mona...you're a brick!' Class!!! The late Mark Lenard a.k.a. Sarek did the voice-over. We need Doc Savage in the 21st Century!!  Really need a re-boot of this movie~!
Dog Day Afternoon 	Watching HollywoodSuites channel during our lunch break! Sonny robs a bank so he can pay for his lover's operation. Awesome portrayals from Al Pacino and John Cazale who star as the bank robbers turned hostage-takers in Dog Day Afternoon.

Dolemite 	A lot of people say the Human Tornado is better than Dolemite. I don't see it, yes it has a bigger budget and the woman look better(although there is one tranny who some guy's may find attractive, I don't). That's all that movie has going for it, Dolemite is more LOL funny to me! Came here because of Ol' Dirty. dolemiteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! buick electra 225! Did someone film this trailer and timetravel to put it in the 70's? Cause I dont believe this was real thing. BLOOP BLACK CRACK SMACK BUDACK ATTACK DONT BE FUCKIN WITH DOLOMITE scene at 0:45 is just too hilarious i cant stop re-watching it hwhahahah this motherfucker got rhythm Hilarious choreography! This trailer doesn't even touch on Dolemite's rap about the sinking of the Titanic. No joke - this is a scene which actually happens.An unforgettable movie. That trailer was more enjoyable than most movies dolemite mothey fhokeh best movie trailer ever Wait so is this a comedy?It just looks terrible... I know that most of the cast consisted of comedians but they all look so serious. they should do a remake of Dolemite!!! Snoop Dogg as Dolemite and Nick Cannon as Willy Green "And tell him I want him out of here in 24 hours... And 23 of 'em already gone." LOL he's like Shaft's retarded twin brother R.i.p "Dolemite is a 1975 blaxploitation feature film, and is also the name of its principal character, played by Rudy Ray Moore, who co-wrote the film and its soundtrack. Moore, who started his career as a stand-up comedian in the late 1960s, heard around that time a rhymed toast by a local homeless man about an urban hero named Dolemite, and decided to adopt the persona of Dolemite as an alter ego in his act."-Wikipedia "Way down in the jungle, deep!"
The Drowning Pool 	Please Bring back Young Justice, but not like you did to Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go ruined the memory of Teen Titans.
The Eiger Sanction 	Really good film.Terrible but unintentionally-hilarious trailer! currently reading this now,enjoying every page of it. George Kennedy and Jack Cassidy were great in this (RIP). Great underrated movie. Clint actually reminds me of Jim Carrey's snappy comebacks.
Eric 	great film great message. if the good guys stick together we can defeat the bad guys. immense movie @lukigolberth thanks a lot :) @LennartPaulsen Mike Schmid-Today I'm ok  :) song name of the last part pls?awesome movie <3
Exhibition	 I saw this movie a few days ago through Netflix. It's  SHIT. Very boring. Nothing happens. It's as fun as watching paint dry. Avoid at all cost. looks like a sleeper to me She looks like an adult Lena Dunham in a good way Tom <3 Seems hilarious and strange
F for Fake 	In my humble opinion, this is one of Welles' best.  Wildly entertaining.
Farewell, My Lovely 	I've not seen Murder My Sweet but this version of Farewell My Lovely is quite a disturbing and sleazy one - which is what it's meant to be. Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe is the equal of Humphrey Bogart's rendition. The 1944 version ("Murder, My Sweet") is better... One of the great films from the 70s. The mood, atmosphere, acting, story and musical score all top shelf. Elliot Gould had the attitude but got to be too cutesy with the part. Marlowe is my favorite smart ass, but he went too far in some parts. Farewell, My Lovely was my favorite book. Lady in the Lake was good and so was long goodbye. Mitchum would have been great as Marlowe when he was young. I think James Badge Dale would be the perfect modern Marlowe. With all respect for Bogart, but Mitchum was the perfect Marlowe I love this movie !! I'm just here for Charlotte Rampling. :) Age is relative Robert Mitchum was a good actor but he was too old for this part. I have left this film running all night at times simply for the atmosphere. No one's ever complained. I still have to see this film but the ending of the trailor is quite haunting. @SteveBrant55 ~ Thank for the tip, but I have a pristine, widescreen copy of it that I recorded on disc, when it aired on Flix. And it only cost $.25 for the blank disc! @Victoria92646 ~ It was released on DVD long ago, and it's long been out of print. A while ago the DVD was available on Amazon, for FOUR HUNDRED BUCKS!!!!! @PetrusRuppert ~ I saw it twice at the Loews State, on Times Square, in 1975. Thanks!  Fabulous Mitchum, Ireland, etc.  and what a score! @Victoria92646 It is!!I saw it here in NY three times in the "moviehouse" (theater) in '75, I got it on Ebay last week and watched it seven times this past week. Look for a vendor named Stelios, who, is in Athens Greece, he deals in these DVDs. Good luck, and have fun. You deserve a break. fantastic movie and the music with the casa loma orch, really puts you in the mood thanks for sharing This to me is the best Portray of Philip Marlowe in a movie, Robert Mitchum was born to play and give life to Philip Marlowe the hard boiled private eye amazing lighting in this movie and direction not to forget great support cast.
Female Trouble 	Divine really mellowed out in terms of her later characters. From a murderous debauchee in Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble to a mild mannered housewife in Polyester and Hairspray. art cinema at it's best Masterpiece. Makes the later John Waters movies look like the Hollywood junk they are. We lost a national treasure. SERIOUSLY. Fucked up, but worth the watch if nothing else is on
Framed 	se ve prometedora :) uff que ganitas de verla! Uuuuuooooooooooh, hype hype hype pedazo currada, no duermo hasta que la vea!!!
French Connection II 	I love the commentators voice methinks this sequel is pretty darn good Fuck sequel snobs. This one was good. Good flick. Not as good as the first but still really good. Love the ending. After watching, rather, listening to the director's comments (J Frankenheimer I believe) I learned that there are actually two deleted scenes which are curiously NOT available on the boxset DVD. He said he was not able to recover the Traffic jam scene and the scene with Reine Prat, the volleyball girl who we see with him exiting the Hotel and parting ways. Apparently, this "hot" scene (one can only suspect) was in the preview version showed to audiences before the official release. I would like to know if anyone knows about this or (really pushing my luck here) has seen that part.My guess is it was deleted because it did not add anything important to the movie after the screening, but it must have meant something if the director took the time to film it... Did they really need to say "French Connection" TEN TIMES in a three minute trailer. He's Popeye the sailer man! synch problem there?? No, he was PD in a 1986 TV film called "Popeye Doyle". The 1981 Sylvester Stallone film "Nighthawks" was originally going to be French Connection 3 until Gene Hackman refused to play Doyle one more time. apart from a certain scene in the girl with the dragon tattoo, what they did to popeye in the second film is the hardest sequence i've ever had to watch in a film, because i fucking love popeye doyle more than any other male character in a film (just like lisbeth more than any other female character). but i wouldn't say that diluted the quality of the film. in fact, i think that's the film's ace card because EVERY movie, especially sequels, have to test the main character to the limit.  i would disagree there, both films displayed fantastic acting @fdsffdd Other way round. FC2's got the better performances. Namely Gene Hackman's. He carries the show.  One of the best films ever made. This has the fastest ending of any film boom - the credits roll. @smizzman I/m not so sure about your other examples. Maybe, but this one certainly is a notch better than the first. @knownpleasures you're insane.  @spideymayne ..Yeah I got a copy of Vengeance a few weeks back..I loved "Exiled" and "The Mission" also, Johnny To has taken the place of John Woo as the badass in hong kong IMO @smizzman thanks for the great comment i loved part 2 equally as part 1 @spideymayne   ..Part 1 is a classic too,  but Part II really grew on me over the years and being I am such a big fan of revenge films, part II became one of my favorite films ever, especially the scenes when popeye gets all of the junk out of his system and goes out looking for some payback, gets me fired up everytime :)
Friday Foster 	friday foster, with pam greir is so pretty an  beautiful  i enjoyed this movie Was that Carl Weathers with the knife? Eartha Kitt: "" A Black Goddess, come to Earth ""   That IS Eartha Kitt, the sexy feline villain from the old Batman TV show; meowwww No she's not cute,she's beyond that oh* she's cute**
Funny Lady 	My favorite movie :) Thank you. This doesn't look very good... Unfortunately Going to see it tomorrow!  I'm so excited!! I know the ratings weren't that good but I don't care, it's Barbra! very romantic , i like Barbra Streisand  Funny, you said ?  I needed to laugh today ... well ... ;))))))) God, this is too much ! Loved this really !

Face is so similar! Both beautiful! I swear FUNNY GIRL is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than this movie....... like like like!! jajaja! very funny. Babs is amazing!!!! I want to see this! were can i watch it!
The Giant Spider Invasion 	I grew up where it was made. Who else has seen the MST3K episode on this movie? in germany at 27.09. on Blu-ray ... Hurra ! Hurra ! Huraa ! :-D EDF EDF EDF The giant pipe-cleaner invasion Spiders like sneaking up on hot chicks in their underwear! Guess I'm safe. SKIPPER!!!! This looks great. Shame it isn't in theaters anymore. Must. Watch. Immediately! SP00KY There has never been a film like this before. Thank God. lol!! WV Beetles with fake spider attachments on them. lol!! Eight Legged Freaks was a much better film and it had Kari Wuhrer and Scarlett Johansson in it. Thumbs up if you're here because of ICHI's track "Giant Spider Invasion" This looks weird. Before there were Snakes On A Plane, there was... The giant spider actually looks realistic. Wow, this was the first "horror" movie I was allowed to watch when I was a kid. I remember it so well :) 'There was never a film like this before'... and luckily there hasn't been another one like it since! This trailer is amazing, apart from the spider in the drawer. I must see this. makes a good christmas gift for sure. Nice going MST3K!
Give 'em Hell, Harry! 	I remember reading how when Harry Truman signed the legislation for the USA to recognize Israel, Eddie Jacobson said "It was for this moment God put you in your mother's womb". Who was that "little congressman from California" Truman was talking about? Ronald Reagan? I'm Irish (48 years old).  Although I knew the main events of Truman's presidency, I had only a vague idea of Truman's personality/character.  I watched the PBS American Experience documentary on Truman last year (2016) and found Truman to be a likeable and usually admirable man.  I've been tracking down more videos about him and am reading McCullough's biography at present.  Thank you for posting this performance. IF WE HAD MORE PEOPLE LIKE TRUMAN THIS COUNTRY OF OURS WOULDN'T BE SO FUCK UP I think this guy deserves an academy award i cryed my eyes out I bought this on VHS many years ago but mine wasn't nearly as clean and clear.  I dubbed it to a DVD but it's just not the same. i like how you included the fbi warning of copyright law.  How funny.  James comey will be at your door soon.  Just pay him for the pizza. This recorded performance was shown in an L.A. theatre to qualify it for the Oscars and James Whitmore was nominated for best actor for his performance. Truly amazing performance! Magnificent. A True Man for his time and for the ages.Strong and Honest  and Straight like a good shot of Bourbon. a superb performance :) What's with the snuffling? I really wish they would do this more often.  We loose talented stage actors all the time and their work is lost forever.I wish we had some sort of archive to lock theses fine performances away for posterity. There was another tv version of Harry Truman. But it wasn't a dramatic version with audiences laughing and clapping and James Whitmore yelling. It was a documentary of him of an actor playing Truman and telling him about his life. I saw it on Channrl 13 in the1970s as a kid. Does anybody no what I'm talking about. Outstanding. This is fantastic!!!! Steven Hewitt, you took the words right out of my mouth!
Great Expectations 	I remember reading the book it was sad but humble at the end. Miss Havisham is  old and miserable. Ok yeah sure, just give away the central plot twist of the movie IN THE DAMN TRAILER bellatrix wyd Voldemort Bellatrix and Hagrid - British actors are like Tasmanians Wait that kissing thing wasn't in the book I'm reading this boom in my school OMG Hated this book in my English class but this movie looks good XD I need a resume of this stori pliz!!!! I still remember the word "he's a common laboring boy" and "you may break his heart" hagrid the dark lord ans bellatrix !!!! I just clicked bc I saw Bellatrix I read the manga version Good thing this trailer doesn't give away most of the story... I've been reading great expectations and Magwitch is my favourite No version of great expectations will ever beat the bbc to series it's as so well done I am not 14 nor drunk to care understand wtf I just watched. Ralph Fienes always shows up in the most random places whattttt
Grey Gardens 	totally forgot about this movie Great work! love Drew in a way this is so relatable. sigh mom.... Big Edie wasn't worth to be a mum once she enslave her for longer than 30 years. Law, policy and even rules are both causing little edie to be like this. She made her wasted and made her hypocrite all the time. Here because I watched a documentary about Alexander Mcqueen on M2M, which referenced the documentary Grey Gardens which further linked to this movie Here because of Documentary Now lol. Does anyone know the name of the song that's  playing in the video??? After seeing clips of her playing Little Edie, I gotta say I now respect her. She did well. wonderful. I love Jessica Lange so much ambas actrices me gustan jessica la mejor loved this movie on so many levels! Blndsundol4mg trish YouTuber life story. So excited to see this
The Hatfields 	and the McCoys Hatfields and McCoys part of White History Month My great great great great grand uncle was the great great great great grand cousin of the great great great great grand son of Devil Anse. I can feel the blood of the Devil on my veins. Fuck off. Good series. While watching for the first time, all I could think about was the ending of "Pain and Gain" and how the private investigator described the perps of that story and how these two families were guilty of the same thing: "The only thing they were not found guilty of, is what they were most guilty of: Being dumb, stupid f**ks" It's a shame Bill Paxton died, he was a great actor. Bill Paxton... in Memorandum Excelent!!! I'll go with W.VA side. anyone know what the song is here in the trailer? RIP Bill Paxton Living in the town Pikeville myself, it amazes me that these grounds that I walk on, everyday, those mountains I take for granted, are apart of something truly tragic. The hollars I live in have untold stories about this feud that we will never know. It just astounds me that such history is in this soil. boa When this was filmed in your country(Romania)...one more reason to love it. Can anyone tell me if the part where Anse Hatfield really deserted the war? if he did then that explains alot. He was no honorable man as his family members which if you see closely they were the ones to start everything from stealing the pigs, unjustly winning the case because the judge of the town was family, the teens romance, the unjustly killing of the McCoy's 3boys instead of handling it thru the law as Ellison Last words were, the killing of the McCoy's other children, leaving mrs. mccoy disabled, burning the house ect. damn.  4 and a half years now since the show aired.  seems like last summer.. this movie was filmed in Romania? aqui tem gente pior muito pior Prepare to Die Jim Vance started the shit
Hearts of the West 	RIPD send me here. One of my all time favorites.
Hester Street 	yo, BT students what up its sykes lol the guy who plays the lawyer is a total comedy! When was this film made? SHALOM, and that's for this gem................... Thank you so much for downloading this gem.!  have been wishing to see it once more for a very long time; Excellent from beginning to end. The oscar should have gone to Carol Kane. I loved it! It was highly recommended by many  , but  I couldn't find available anywhere. Thanks so much for uploading. 1:14:35 - 1:17:32   The marriage proposal scene is the one of the most beautiful in film.  Re-wets my contact lenses every time. boring ... Saw this in the Hillel at Brooklyn College in the 70s. The sound  was  a little off then too. There are scenes where you  can see the boom mike . Carol Kane should have won something for this. She was  even in the Last Detail. Wish they would show it on PBS Does anyone remember a movie with Kate Burton about Ellis Island around 1980-1986? It is about immigrants...It is not the series with Faye Dunaway? Please help!!! I am so taken with this film- it's moving, thought provoking, charming all in one film. The performances and the ensemble of actors are so exceptional.   Thanks so much for sharing it. "A regular uptown lady!"  Doris Roberts you gave the world much joy.  RIP. Their Yiddish is very good.  Their "Yiddishe accent" is a bit strained for a number of actors.  As someone who is used to hearing these New York Yiddishe accents, a number of these actors are really forcing their attempt to speak with a "Yiddish accent."  It's almost distracting and stereotypical New York.  And most of these actors are from the 5 boroughs, which is interesting. Great movie - thanks for posting.  I thought of this movie when I heard Doris Roberts had died at 90.  She is great in this.  Since it came out in 1975 Roberts mush have been pushing 50 when it was made.I love these "understated" flicks.  So-called action movies are so mindless.  This had no hero barely hanging on tho a speeding train or whatever, just great characters and a real story. kane was nominated for an award on this - louise fletcher got it though for nurse ratched role Great! Excellent film, thank you for sharing
Hey, I'm Alive 	algo ironico es que en el juego le crece el cabello o.O
The Hiding Place 	good holocaust movie... Going to visit Harleem on MAy 2016 I am currently reading this book at school and I think it is a really emotional story she died when I was born....great story and really touched....... seems like a great movie read book so sad and what was amazing was that she was spreading the word of God. It's so weird how trailers like this straight up TELL you about the movie, as oppose to the showing style we see today. *SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!*yes, she does, but her sister dies. One amazing thing was that she and a few other women had messed up papers, so they weren't supposed to leave but did anyway. A week later, the camp they left was sent to an extermination camp, so they got out just in time :)   Is it as good?  You call a politician a Nazi, then tuck tail and run when the French threaten to riot. If she really was a Nazi why did you back down? Or when did the Boy Scouts try to assassinate a 15 yr old girl? When did the Scouts ever behead a 10 yr old boy? Yet you have the hutzpah to compare them to the Taliban. And Scouts are so much classier than you could ever hope to be that they ignored you. Something you can't stand :D Did you ever read the book or see the movie Mija? These Christians, the kind of peopl you hate, saving Jews. And they paid for it with their freedom and their lives. But somehow that's not good enough for you. Your country brought this horror show to an end. Yet you deride & desert your country in her time of need, while sleeping with a man who thinks Hitler was a great man and the murders of 6,000,000 Jews was a good thing.  What a truthful and powerful comment and viewpoint. Thank you for caring to notice. I lost 90% of my family in those camps. I will always remember what Corrie said: "No place is so deep, that He is not deeper still." My Uncle Chaim had Mengele's henchmen ram a glass rod up his penis and smash it with a hammer for the sake of white supremacy and ethnic cleansing, but mostly, for the sake of pure hatred. It will all end soon for God will "bring to ruin those ruining the earth." - Revelation 11:18 You're awfully careless with the terms Nazi and 666, Mija. You use them as if they weren't one in the same along with Islam.... Yeah ...white people are not evil The love of many has waxed cold. How could anyone look at Anne Frank's picture and say to themselves they could kill that little girl. It's horrible to think that. You can't, I can't. I'm saddened.  This movie is very different from the book :( I saw this movie years ago - read the book and The Return to The Hiding Place. It literally changed my life. I have passed this on through the years and live by Bestsie's saying, "There's no pit so deep, that He is not deeper still." Must have been longer than 12 years, seeing when she died. That's not possible.   She died in 1983.    Do a search on Corrie Ten Boom.
The Hindenburg 	80 years ago today... What a mind-blowing ending. I just got the movie on blu-ray at Wal-Mart, and never in my life did I expect such a shocker of an ending from a '76 picture. From 1:29 to 1:34 is when you can see footage in color that ended up B/W in the film. Some of the the black&white scenes are real historical footage they added in this movie ( they did that alot in war movies back then ) . The ending in black&white gives a deeper emotion of sadness imo . Anyway this movie is excellent because there were great actors/actresses . They dared to remake this movie but the CGI fails + they put again a love story and the colors as the acting are way too clean . If anyone is interested in finding a behind the scenes featurette for this film, it is likely to be in the UCLA archives. I have proof here: https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/Steinhart08_ARSC_Award.pdf Thank you for posting this ! I never got to see the trailer :) I wished I saw it in 70 mm it would have been spectacular ! The UK (English) copy of the DVD is very clear as Anchor Bay Entertainment ordered a new print be struck for their release ! Released on Christmas Day of 1975 and Directed by Robert Wise THE HINDENBURG was Universal's BIG Christmas attraction of 1975 that featured George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft in the title roles. They advertised the cost of the movie!!!!!  they did it's in the Laserdisc version. The DVD and VHS versions converted them to b/w. One gasbag meets another.  I can confirm the quality of the audio track on the Laserdisc release. It actually surprised me. never saw the DVD release though.Hmm. My Laserdisc player still works. Maybe I should watch it again. This film had a brilliant 4-track mag stereo soundtrack that is preserved pretty well on the LaserDisc.  The DVD doesn't sound as good.  The dialog was originally panned to follow the actors but remixed for home video. I hope they fix that for a Blu-ray release.  It was planned to be released in Sensurround but Midway and Rollercoaster were booked in all the Sensurround theaters, so it was standard 35mm and 70mm stereo surround. I only wish they would show the disaster ending in color instead of b/w.  I love these classic 1970s disaster movie trailers. This is done so well just like the "The Towering Inferno"  The sound effects, the soundtrack placed so well in sinc with the film footage. It really gets you to the core!  Well done! :)  I have a DVD of this movie but unlike most of my other DVD's it has no extras like this trailer, & I'm disappointed this trailer is not there. Am not sure.  Have caught some of the Al Whitlock docs but haven't seen it shown up there. Was just remarking on the earlier scenes in color, Vogel being blown back in the tail fin after the explosion-Pruss in the control car-passengers thrown off feet in the lounge - those scenes ended up being black & white in final print. Thank you for posting this elusive trailer!  Now I don't have to dig out my projector to view the Super 8 sound release of this.  Proof is here that they filmed the destruction scenes in color before draining out color to splice with newsreel footage. Next if someone can post that making-of featurette I've heard about...
Hong quan xiao zi 	This is the best, made me cry @LRGKING1991 Yeah, but it costs a lot of money to run a website like Youtube so it is eitheradvertisements or no Youtube at all.  nice  :D
The 'Human' Factor 	Vigilante movies like this one are the most fun. They don't make 'em like this anymore... Can anybody post this film part by part? Thanks
Hustle 	love this show love this show Fave show Adrian Lester looks like Barack Obama. Can you tell me more about it? Are there some backstage shots.. Techniques used? Etc... I miss hustle please bring it back bbc How do they do the freeze effect Watched an old episode repeated on Sony TV on Sky + I recorded and recalled this - nice to see it again after all these years. I still wish they'd used the music in this trailer for the shows theme tune actually - anyone know what it is and is it on youtube? Really cool trailer and agree its stood the test of time. Been trying to work out a way to film a similar sequence for ages, but really having some difficulty! best promo ever.  lol tht cork! Nice promo. I like the time slice.could you please breakdown this shot for us.I'd love to know how to produce a similar effect.I know tis been used in the last season of CSI and er.. Dexter as well.
Hustling 	I like the retro style of the ladies in this movie. what is the name of the song playing in the backround? estos trailers de merda te cuentan toda la pelicula menudo salame el que los hace great trailer for me phuck yeah That was a very crap trailer Donald Trump remind me of this movie. The only reason I watched this movie is because Led Zeppelin's "Good Times Bad Times" was in this trailer... 10 nominated, 0 oscar???!!! Cmon... One of the unlucky biggest looser in the Academy history! (Also The shawshank redemption) favorite actress Jennifer Lawrence LED ZEPPELIN <3 Boooring movie!!! never will be as good as wolf of wall street The Art Of Survival is A Story That Never Ends Some seriously talented actors in this,i thoroughly enjoyed it,9/10 for me. such a sexy trailer!! how ya doin u know wat i mean I don't see it! Good times bad times Too long I got bored... tbh I'm more of a disney-musical, rom-com gal, but I have to say, this movie was great. The characters had a lot of depth, and the actors were able to bring that out. Definitely recommend.
I Will Fight No More Forever 	Contrast a photo of the real Chief Joseph with this actor, and imagine the real Chief Joseph speaking these words, and then you know that the real moment was 100 times more moving and more tragic than this recreation.
In This House of Brede 	Yes, please upload this great movie. If not possible, do you know where to get it on VHS? Fabulous - although they took some ferocious liberties with the original book. Diana Riggs Great from Head to Toe meet her in new York when she did medea Wow wish someone with the ability would upload this wonderful movie...I've been looking for it for ages. Please upload it...it's a fabulous film!
India Song 	What a surprise to find this upload! Thank you! The film is infuriatingly baffling, mysterious, haunting, and hypnotic. Has to be seen 50 times. kiitos How sweet now remembering how bittersweet was at first sight...  Do you have the rest of India Song?  Could you possibly upload it?
Janis 	Many thanks! She was a real diva When is this out on dvd anyone know ? Amazing documentary... love janis Pls link! yay cat power I can't wait to see this looks good I need link that clip is that? 0:42 must watch this movie. Love Janis Joplin so badly!:'( <3 I didn't know this woman but I cried,so emotional..I can relate to her ...I was bullied as a child in school even nowadays..and that makes many people stronger in a way and more sensitive to other peoples feelings This was actually a pretty tame documentary. It glossed over a lot of things, like Janis's sexual relationships with other women and  her final fling with the atrocious Seth Morgan. I found it disappointing. I need link waw This made me cry. I couldn't decide before whether or not I liked her music but after seeing this documentary she is one of my favourite artists. Beautiful soul The title of this documentary is wrong!  It should be "Little Girl Blue"...How could someone make this mistake?!! Beautiful, cant wait to see the full movie! Janis is the queen psychedelic rock and She will always have 'piece of my heart' The only good film that's come out this year What a voice. VIVA ROCK AND ROLL
Jaws 	Jaws is with a killer Shark and blood I wonder if James Earl Jones did the voice over. He Has Survived Million Years RevolutionA Mindless Eatting Machine.It Will Attack And Our Entrything. It If This God Creative The Devil And Gave Him JAWS. Thanks to this  movie, I am Thalassophobia. im confused is the shark named megalodon or great white They put electronic hairs.

Johnny Firecloud 	I have to watch "They bought themselves an all-American, one-man Indian massacre!" loll man is this comedy loll Indians no longer bit the dust...they just ate dirt Kind of hard to tell, octo... For a moment, I thought this clip *was* from Bo za. LOL Was that David Canary from Bo za? Would this be a step up or step down in his career? Dem Indians sho look white. We need a modern movie that stars native americans as the heroes and main characters of a positive film. A film that makes it past the underground to the mainstream.
The Kansas City Massacre 	Western Allies would won WW 2 earlier if these gangster fought NAZI back there..damn their car ram better than Sherman.. Both scenes incredibly inaccurate based on known history. Seems like a Bollywood movie with white guys This was a perfectly awful movie. Neither Melvin Purvis nor Pretty Boy Floyd had anything to do with the Kansas City Massacre (although the FBI still insists on that delusion). Also, the FBI agents at the KCM didn't have guns, because they weren't yet authorized to carry them. J. Edgar Hoover used the KCM as an excuse to petition Congress to allow his agents to carry firearms. It was one of the few smart things he did in his 40 years of sadistic incompetence as head of the FBI. Some good shots of B.A.R.s in this scene. You usually don't see that weapon in too many gangster flicks...shame. :( I'm currently barred by YouTube from uploading videos longer than 15 minutes, which is a real pain.  I have a DVD of the movie (which is very rare) and know of no online versions, sorry.  Interesting that your uncle was in it.  He must've had a ball as it looks like a movie where there was a lot of fun. If you have the full movie then upload the rest of it please or send me a link so I can watch it for myself !!My uncle is on this movie and his name is Lester Maddox Yes, it's a pretty rare movie now.  I'm not sure how factually correct it is (a lot of it seems slightly tongue in cheek, given that this was based on a real story) but it's a fun gangster flick for all that. 37 years ago I watched this movie in Monterrey, Mexico obviously in Spanish, vaguely I remember the movie, I remember very well the start when Frank is released by Pretty Boy Floyd, I really would like to watch it again if I could or get it through DVD, hopefully someday I can watch it again and remember this part of my childhood.
Katherine 	good job ... but i dont understand Unforgettable Was Definitely Katherine Heigls Movie, Forget Rosario Dawson, Go Katherine!!!!! cine e de la Ilie Vlogs? Ilie? ummm y is the trailer so long and showing all of the best highlights of the movie? bummer! 4.6 at 2:00 you can tell Heigl hired that guy to attacked her so she can drive her away from her ex-husband Rosario looks pretty hot here too. Got to see it yay, catfight.  There'd better be a mud wrestling pit in the movie or it's really gonna suck. George Stults plays the husband? Lol. Was there a budget cut, for this part? *Yawn* Next! Never divorce a woman with borderline personality disorder she reminds me of Ivanka Trump lol very similar both outside and in! cray cray hoes.... just like that gone girl lol why go see the movie when u basically get the gist of it here bullshit
The Killer Elite 	WHO WATCHING IT 2017?Jason statham is the best actor ever i saw please upload F&F 7 In case anyone is wondering about the vintage silver car Statham is driving in one part of the trailer: 1971 Buick GSX-440 V-8 with Dark Billet Silver as the color. this guy don't scare easily lol 1:52 what would daisy ridley do?  she would cry im british and we cant sleep together and she would sign me to star wars so i can rip into the governments war on marriage and love instead of going after nuclear weapons which are already in the hands of terrorists, exclusively, obviously good shooter or you enjoy killing animals?  because i checked publix is the devil prohibiting jews from marrying dont i have a shit load of these at my disposal? Jason statham is JASON STATHAM in .. Jason Statham I think this is Statham's best movie. LOLZ 0:52 "His condom scaries me" :D:DD:D:D ok how many badasses are in this movie? 1,2,,3 :O Based on a true story dafuq ? so true man. he was pretty baller in Ronin too Ah ok. I could always count on the bank robbery getaway scene in 'Heat' as one of the most remarkable moments of De Niro(with an M4 lol).  naw man, i got what you were going for! i love puns. flawless is one of his earlier movies Awww, dude! You totally missed what I did there!  it looks 'Flawless'... I can feel the 'Heat' already... De Niro shooting an M4.. i gotta see this
The Kingfisher Caper 	the trailer doesn't do it justice...this movie will make you cry. best romantic comedy I've ever seen Its mental Wow this trailer is the exact opposite of the movie's tone! One of the top 5 all time movies. such a great cast....whatever happened to Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer? One of the best movies! I don't think they spent enough time studying what homeless life was/is really like. To walk through those doors hand in hand, side by side, is the dream. I didn't even know I could dream that big. Until there was you. Until there was you. Over all terrible movie... with some interesting parts.  RIP Robin. perfect movie, the best ever!! The trailer doesn't do this justice. Amazingly good movie. Damn! Forgot all about this gem, think I'll get a copy from Amazon. Incredible movie.
The Land That Time Forgot 	Script by Michael Moorcock! saw this at the drive-in when I was six. Great childhood memories. When your special effects aren't even as good as Land Of The Lost (which came out about the same time), you SUCK. Wasn't there a clip of this in Wargames? Grindhouse this will be on bluray in a few days. cant wait. Lost world, dinosaurs, U-boat...life was so simple and beautiful back then, I miss my youth years~ Why they add cheep puppeteer dinosaurs why not hired Ray Harryhousan to do stop motion Dinosaurs that will be cool. It's hard to believe it is 40 years since this movie was made (Filming started early in 1974, released in 1975). I had been a fan of Doug McClure only 12 years at the time, having first seen him in "Checkmate" and then "The Virginian". 3 years ago I was part of a campaign to have him inducted posthumously into the Hall of Great Western Performers and I attended his induction last April and met his daughters, widow and grand daughter. I remember going to see this film, I must have been about twelve, I was a dinosaur nut, anything with dinosaurs in, I remember it being previewed on the tea time Film magazine show, Clapperboard, with Chris Kelly, it was billed as a great film with stunning special effects, a good twenty years before Jurassic Park, looking back at it now, you realise how god awful the effects were, and the Dinosaurs wouldn't scare my dog, but it was fun, I miss the GOOD OLD DAYS!!! wha t aload o fcrap! 38 yrs. later and this version still looks better than the remake with C. Thomas Howell. "Mr. Tyler.... Ahhhhhhhhhh" this movie was kinda better than the people that time forgot (1977). My favorite thing about this movie is, if not for cover art, you might have just thought this was war movie unitl, like, 45 minutes into the film. I just saw this movie on my new favorite channel Turner Classic Movies. And I can say that I'm glad I watched it! Great movie. I spent my whole life looking for this movie..omg..mission completed! The movie that time forgot.
The Last Day 	This is good movie oh no if the owners of animals die then the pets will die unless they have a catflap or whatether that is called Lookes like Metro 2033 I didnt whatched the movie,is it a zombie movie or? love this movie......

I liked it...mix between mad max and hunger games so excited for Haley!!!!!i hope she sees this Bad ass! Can't wait to see it! Haley lu Richardson is my girl!! :)
The Legend of Lizzie Borden 	I wanna go to the house and talk to the Gordon's hosts GREAT TV FILM It's a trial film. I have found no suspens nor surprise after 40 minutes:I'm bored, I'm out. Lizzie Borden took an axeShe gave her mother forty whacks.When she saw what she had doneShe gave her father forty-one.Lizzie Borden got awayFor her crime she did not pay. Kinda like the OJ Trial of their time:  An obviously guilty-as-hell defendant getting off Scott-free, thanks to a smooth-talking shyster defense-attorney, a prosecutor with his head up his butt (you NEVER let a witness get near the stand until & unless you know every syllable of their testimony ahead of time) and a jury apparently made up of "special needs" children who'll believe anything, no matter how ludicrous....Good movie, although bringing up the whole "women's rights" stuff seemed a little irrelevant to the case--I mean, let's face it, if she really truly got "equal rights" and had received the same equal treatment a male defendant would've gotten, she'd have been tried, convicted & hanged in probably less time than it took for this case to go to trial.  Which is what happened in the nearly-identical case of axe-murder William Kemmler only a couple of years earlier.  (Kemmler being best remembered in history as being the first man to test the then-new method of execution known as "Old Sparky," the electric chair...) Was this filmed at her house? I think she did it. And I can't say that I blame her. a The jurists who presided over the trial essentially instructed the jury to render a verdict of "Not Guilty."  One of the three judges basically argued for the Defense.  Lizzie's lead council was the former Governor of Massachusetts who, while in office, appointed the chief magistrate to the bench.Although I believe Lizzie Borden did not wield the hatchet herself, I do believe that she and her sister Emma called upon their Uncle John Morse to coordinate the conspiracy to have the elder Borden and his wife Abby murdered.  Evidence of an illegitimate son of Andrew came to light at the time of the trial, but was dismissed as "irrelevant" by the Attorney General who tried the case for the prosecution -- despite the AG's written notes that there was strong evidence that the son openly confronted Andrew Borden regarding his legacy and that Andrew threw the son out of his house.Uncle Morse was the brother of Emma and Lizzie's true mother, who passed away when Lizzie a small child.  Certainly Morse's sympathies lay with the daughters of his late sister.  Andrew was 69 years old, not in the best of health, and was more likely to pass away before his younger wife.  Andrew had no Will, so the bulk of his Estate would lawfully pass to Abby.  Strict adherence to privacy and an innate distrust of persons outside his small circle of confidantes, Andrew often turned to his brother-in-law to discuss issues in matters of law, which would include the drawing up of a Will.Uncle John Morse was in Fall River (visiting from his mid-western home state) for a few days before he dropped in on the Bordens, where he slept on the eve of the murders.  Interestingly, he slept in the guest room next to Lizzie's bedroom, allowing for a close proximity that would otherwise be impossible if Morse had taken his usual bed in the attic.Before the actual crime, little attention was paid to the Bordens' comings and goings.  I believe Morse was responsible for locating Andrew's illegitimate son, convincing the young man to commit the crimes, and for sneaking the man into the Borden house on the eve of the murders.  Emma was out of town, so the man could have easily hidden himself in Emma's bedroom, which adjoined Lizzie's.  The son's close proximity to Lizzie would be another reason for John Morse to sleep in the next room.During the police investigation that followed the murder, the man identified as being Andrew Borden's illegitimate was being sought as a possible witness.  Police came upon his body, hanged in a tree.  The police declared the man had committed suicide, though evidence of suicide was at best negligible and, at worst, non-existent.  The only person who could have named the Borden sisters and their uncle as complicit in the murders he committed suddenly ends up dead himself. I saw this movie when I was a kid and was blown away by Elizabeth Montgomery's performance. She was so convincing in this role. if you think Elizabeth Montgomery's great wait till you see Christina Ricci who also directed her Lizzie Borden and has a sequel we are all waiting for the new sequel to come out Christina Ricci rocks enjoyed the movie...thanks for making it available. Don''t miss the second version recently made with Christina Ricci [yep, Wednesday of the Addams Family movie of 1991]. Far gruesome! Using an axe----it must have been awfully messy. I can understand her rage. I guess there's an unedited European Theatrical Cut out there somewhere.  Would love to track that down. This movie gave me nightmares when I saw it on TV in 1975 as a kid, but it did inspire me to read everything I could about the Borden double-murder case.My conclusions (for what they are worth):  Lizzie almost certainly did it--but if she didn't do it, she knew who did it and she was in on the planning.  The 90 minutes between the two murders strongly indicates it was an inside job.  No intruder would linger that long in the home between murders.Lizzie's uncle--who isn't even mentioned in this TV movie even though he was visiting the Bordens at the time of the murders--was acting strangely on the day of the murders.  He was likely an ally of Lizzie's.  When pressed for an alibi, he said he was in Fall River's business district and was remarkably able to remember the badge numbers of the motormen who were driving the streetcars he had ridden!  (Who memorizes that bit of trivia--unless one is trying to desperately trying create an alibi to prove one was not at the murder site at the time of the killings?)The two murders were especially violent and brutal.  The Bordens' doctor, who was a Civil War veteran, said the wounds reminded him of some of the worst battlefield casualties he had seen.  A hired killer would not keep striking his victims multiple times with a hatchet.  One or two blows would have been sufficient to do the job.  Whoever did the killings was in a violent rage, likely someone who knew the victims personally and had a score to settle. One interesting but totally unproven theory I've read was that Lizzie and the maid (Bridget Sullivan) were secretly lesbian lovers--and they were caught in the act by Mrs. Borden.  She may have told Lizzie that she was going to inform her father--which may have resulted in Lizzie being written out of his will.  Lizzie never married nor did she ever show any romantic interest pertaining to men. One thing is for certain:  Lizzie's gender absolutely benefited her legal defense and led to her acquittal.  It was incomprehensible to most men in the 1890s that a woman could kill two family members by any means--never mind in such a brutal manner.  The all-male jury from this trial could not make that leap.  A male defendant would have been found guilty very quickly. This movie scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. I kept telling myself it's just Samantha on  Bewitched. Montgomery was excellent.  That scene where she menaces her stepmother in a confrontation really scared me...lol
Lepke 	could somebody show the whole movie.do you have the whole movie.
Lies 	My Father Told Me It was up on Youtube but no longer, perhaps copyright issues with release of remastered version? Sad ending in this movie. I can't wait to see this.
Murph the Surf 	I worked for this guy in 7 rivers "Murph the Surf" {1975}Also withDonna Mills {Age; 35}Robyn Millan {Age 26}The word in Hollywood, was that Donna Mills was having an affair withRobert Conrad at the time. Two bikini beach babes at the 4:41 mark, I'm going to watch this movie! Yep it looks like what you see on youtube. my email is  at the end of this video clip Ah. I recorded this on vcr in the early 80's. I tried watching it a few years ago and it looks horrible. If your dvd copy looks like this on youtube I'm interested. Very decent. I have dvds for sale I used to watch this all the time in the late 70's. I really want this on dvd!
Love Among the Ruins 	The sexual ambiguity and innuendo in this film is beautifully charming in such a subtle dramatic way that only these two excellently talented people can portray. The likes of Kathryn Hepburn and Laurence Olivier will never walk into film or on stage ever again. I could see Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews doing this movie. Botching it...lol finally the most over rated homosexual actor and lesbian actress meet to ruin cinema ;and thus was designed by our lord ! both were extremely theatrical and artificial ;there is nothing spontaneous or natural about both and they are so monotonous in dialogue delivery with pretentious accents and atrocious mannerisms ;all of that is aplenty to observe in this dull and boring flop in the ruins ! regards;in fact kate looks more macho and authoritative than larry ;I just pity poor vivirn leigh a much better actress than both and so accommodating to that marital charade ! she was the only victim in this horrendous affair over 3 decades and hats off to miss leigh for her dignity and tolerance ;mutton dressed like lamb indeed LostCinemaChanel. Me encantan sus peliculas podrian ponerles subtitulos o doblarlas al castellano Muchas Gracias Dios los Bendiga. Katharine Hepburn always gave an excellent performance. Her expressions, intonations, truly superb. Great fun indeed !  Thank you ! I'm only 74 years old, and have seen, "Love..." on the stage performed by a spectacular ensemble crew of actors and actresses (yes, I still prefer that word to the unisex version), yet when the film progressed to the Robert Browning quote at the end, I found myself blubbering in my may wine.  No fool like an old fool, I guess...  Rob the Elder Thank you for posting this movie =) at 1:05- he says she called him 'Squidgey'- is that where Diana and James Hewitt got it from???? One of the most charming movies ever made. The dialogue was delightful, delivery was superb and it is a joy to watch. switched off. so dreary The King and Queen of acting...in their late years and still on their tip toes,that says only:Professional! Lovely movie! Ty 4 sharing such a clean classic movie 4 all of us! Brilliant.
Love and Death 	Great movie ! Very funny and clever.
Lucky Lady 	Thanks!! Thanks for posting the trailer.
Mahogany 	Thanks for posting. when this movie came out I've seen it 10times now I have it on DVD watch it whenever I can Love this movie Oh God. I felt that slap! Super nova Diana Ross was made in Detroit. Love, LOVE, L-O-V-E this movie! Excellent movie!!! donde puedo conseguirla para verla With only 5 films under her belt, each one made their own individual mark. "Mahogany" has been paid homage to in music videos by artists like Mary J. Blige and lesser known singer-songwriter, Tweet.l I loved the film, the music & all those crazy costumes. My only criticism would be at the end (spoiler alert) Sure it's great that came back to Brian, but she could have still been a designer in Chicago. This was during the feminist women's movement. A woman or man can have a career & a great love.  just watched this...great movie :) Mahogany was released October, 1975.
The Man Who Would Be King 	Narrator is Rankin/Bass Gandalf Does anyone remember the old cartoon: (man) Do you like Kipling? (woman) I don't know. I've never Kippled. Rudyard Kipling: responsible for the original "Road to" story. :) Is that Huston at the start? At first I thought he was one of the Morroccans. Who is the guy narrating? All Dad's should show this Great Film to their Children - a Masterpiece on many levels. Such an exciting, adventurous movie.Nothing like it today .... To the Tune "The Minstrel Boy". I was lucky I got to see this one twice on the big screen, once in a theater and then in a Drive in. Gee's I was just 20 then. Shakira Caine is a sort of dark pearl here... Best movie ever! At 1:10, this is one of my very favorite scenes of all time. Daniel and Peachey have been brought before a high-ranking British official for trying to bribe an Indian Raj. They are utterly unrepentent. Peachey (Michael Caine) ends the "interview" by defiantly attacking the official for ... "Detriments, you call us?!  DETRIMENTS?!?! I'll have you know that it was 'detriments' like us that built this bloody Empire!!!" Very funny. Connery and Caine should have made more flicks together. I need to see this... the son of god goes of to war. hope this helps Do you mind expanding on why YOU think she was not suited for the role? I love this movie. It is the story of colonialism and decolonization in microcosm. I think Kipling knew where things were headed.  This movie includes an egregious case of artistic nepotism.Caine's wife plays a role . . . for which she is completely unsuited. Wow this trailer spoilers a lot. A little bit of trivia that I have already posted on another youtube video about this terrific movie. The guy who plays the very old high priest, with the extremely crinkled face .... was actually a 100-year-old shepherd in Morocco, where most or all of the "Sikander Gul" scenes were filmed. Not only that, but he tended his flocks at night, then came to the set to film the movie. He had practically no sleep for the days that involved him in the filming. No wonder his eyes were very bloodshot!! @LongknifeTrooper Yeah that's John Huston who introduced the video and narrates the trailer. Check out CHINATOWN if you haven't already seen it, Huston gives a great performance as the film's antagonist. why cant there be a full movie on youtube
The Man in the Glass Booth 	HAIL HITLER Gimme some reasons why I should watch this. Schell got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for it!!! I wish they still could/would make movies like TMITGB. Today's movie are mostly special effects and boring SLOP. One of the best movies I have ever seen. If you're a member, Netflix has it on their Instant Queue menu Jinkies! THANKS for sharing this fascinating footage with us!  Most people don't know this highly acclaimed play was written by the late great actor Robert Shaw, who was probably best known for his performance in the classic movie thriller "Jaws".   @BondoFox it was inspired by the Eichmann kidnapping. @djbm73 According to IMDB - In a 2005 interview, Arthur Hiller confirmed that Robert Shaw asked that his name be put back on the film after he saw the finished movie. However, by that time, all prints had been made and it was too late to include his name in the titles. Alternatively, according to the DVD, another reason cited was because Robert Shaw had died. Does anyone know what Robert Shaw's problem with the film was? I agree  Mr. Hammersley. . It is a Masterpiece and Mr. Schell is brilliant. Could any other actor have created the character that Schell did? Richard Burton perhaps. As a German, Mr. Schell reveals the pride and resignation of an officer in the Third Reich. But where does the self-loathing Jew come from? His character is possessed by both of them and he shifts from one to the other effortlessly. It is a remarkable performance. I was so impressed , I bought a ticket to the next show . But Robert Shaw didn't approve - he disowned the movie! The original play and novel on which this film is based was written by the actor Robert Shaw.It is a most intriguing piece of theatre with an bravura performance by Schell. All I'd ever seen of this movie was toward the end when it was on PBS in the 70's.  All this time I thought it was about Adolph Eichmann.Now I *have* to see this movie.  Thanks for posting the trailer!
Mandingo 	And the majority of white folks think we have a problem! damn... ken norton is an art the body and the face is a monument.i wish i was born black Stay away from whores by all means necessary. ..They will destroy your life. this kind ofmovies truly depicts the brutality and barbary of whites, you'll see that nowadays they ton the movies about slavery down ,, taking the roles of the idiot racists , trying to de dramatize the situation, sorry too late the damage is done "you aint whippi him right let me show you how to do it !"  best comedy of all time The immense brutality, abuse, oppression & suffering the African went through in this western hemisphere!! You wonder why there's a group named "Black lives matter".. Was that Susan George?  Spawned 10000 bad pornos... Oh yeah Mandingo dies.  Wasn't hatred, was cheap labor force combined with bad morals.  who would a white girl refuse with a hunky black guy like mandingo? so Mandingo dies DICK FUCKS MANDINGO 2 FOR MALORY ARCHER

Mr. Ricco 	Dean's laid back performance in this, in my view, was wonderful.  He still had the acting chops!  Underrated movie. I would like to see the entire movie...any suggestions where to buy? Dean Martin's 51st film, his last real dramatic role. It was made in 1974 and was released in January of 1975. Dean's performance was seen as uninvolved and too laid-back, although the other performers' roles were praised. Dean Martin and Philip Micheal Thomas in the same scene - now I have seen it all
Murder on Flight 502 	Looks dumb...Non-stop was excellent.  this is great! who's going to pop up next! Sonny!Danny!Theodore Bikel!!!Farrah!Robert Stack!Polly! and more!!! great just to see the aulde faces...

I was afraid to sit next to a window. Must watch this!
The Naked Civil Servant 	This is one of my favorite movies ever.
Nashville 	You can watch Naaashville heeere https://twitter.com/68f5c63c93e68bff6/status/836773262143053824 american horror story? #BringBackNashville who remembers" save the cheerleader, save the world"?- Hiro Nakamura I remember Connie Britton as Vivian harmon, Hayden panettiere as Claire Bennett omg its so weird to watch this without lennon and masie. Do all women hate each other Is the blonde on from Bring It On? I'm so glad they changed Raina's kids. Lennon and Maisy are just perfect. What episode is that at 3:07 What happens to Daphne and Maddie at 1:20? This is ahs 4 ahahahah Hey my family knows the owner of that house before they sold it to Nashville.her name is Sylvia.

The Nickel Ride 	does anyone know this was the movie Jason Miller refused to leave to take the role in Taxi Driver.Imagine the history. Higgins !!! From playwright to priest... to crime boss. God bless SF 4 this release. They should work with Grindhouse Releasing & Code Red 2 release Family Honor, Family Enforcer Directors cut, Gone With The Pope & Massacre Mafia style. While were at it they should team up with De Laurentiss's family & release Crazy Joe officially. Good job on this & Capone. While were at it I'm sure the fans would die for an official Brinks Job release. Also would be cool 2 have The Outfit with Robert Duvall. Just my opinions. Either way major props. Luv this film One of Robert Mulligan's very best films. This a great film that does lose its way a bit sometimes... but there are some great scenes and its very low key and down to earth, it has a realistic feel to it which makes it stand the test of time. I love quirky 70s films like this as they happen in real time with longer shots that tend to roll out and give you the feeling your there watching. Excellent movie
Night Moves 	By far the worst movie iv ever seen.  Excepting something to happen but never did.  Not even kidding wouldn't recommend this shit to anyone... I thought this was going to be a documentary about Bob seger and the plot is?? now I'll just have to watch it kelly, i'm sorry but... this is expensive waste of shit. Peeps, tooth Work sounds dheply radmaker   :< this film was alright, a bit slow & boring in places This movie was probably a 6.5/10 for me. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and adds to the great atmosphere. So I'm Watching This & I'm Like Are They Drug Dealers Like I Don't Get What's Going On I agree with yg padawan This film had me so tense. I needed Jesse to hold my hand! Lol... it seems like it would be boring but not at all! this movie shows and makes us feel the anxiety the we would feel if we mistakenly involve ourselves in some fucked up situation .....we get suspicious only after we are really into the situation and there is no coming back....and slowly the tension develops.....this is going to be cool i came for jesse i love jesse sm It's sort of an act of eco-terrorism really, I suppose. Anna Is A Stool Pigeon anybody? I love this kind of filmmaking, kelly reichardt did such a good job. There's so much freedom in smaller movies like these, which makes the creative process more beautiful and heartfelt. either they show the whole movie in the trailer or they show nothing at all!! Drugs dealers or something? Lex Luthor
Noi non siamo angeli 	bellissimo, uno dei film della mia infanzia!
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 	That nurse should have died a thousand times. That's Danny de Vito!! Woow... he was so cute! ^_^ Great movie. Never in my wildist dreams I'd end up like this character. Or the one in last emperor:( Anyone want to watch this cause of metalica fade to black? We learned about a woman's insane asylum and they shocked them and drowned them and that's in this movie. My teacher said that. oww billy bibbit x3 Where is his emphasized red orange hair that the book likes talking about all the time. Lmao. But besides that this movie looks exactly like the book  The mavericks live in austin texasw I think Jack nicholson played his real himself in this movie . the bfi in thsi movie or big fuckin indian as my buds would say is canadian woot This movie never gets old. The ending makes me cry every time. Ive just read the book. The movie seems exactly like the book. That's where I am going  to this say my favourite movie - jacks extremely talented The only movie to ever make me cry, and feeling empathy tends to be a challenge for me. Micheal Douglas produced this movie
Peeper 	Cant believe ppl are making movies like these! Pathetic storyline Does Jessica Pare get naked  ? Love it. Can't wait to see it! OH GREAT MROE RACISMFROM The "ObAMANIA" crowd!!!!!!  HOW MANY TImES WILL THE HOLLYWOOD ELITES KEEP MAKING THEIR SO-CALLED FAMILY MOVIES THAT ARE REALLY ANTI-FAMILY TRASH?!?!?!?!  No thanks i will spend my money on more uplifting movie I was an extra in part of this trailer...although only the audio was used from the scene that i am in in this trailer...guess who i am? This has "hit of the year" written all over it!
Double Exposure 	I think this happened to Linda Sobeck in 1995...Thanks for the upload...!! same school of acting as Don't Answer the Phone. sweaty. 1:15 "The sheriff is near!!!!" Obscure is right...ugh Really good thriller :-) and it is still banned here in Germany...stupid censorship...
Picnic at Hanging Rock 	Lol I went there a couple days ago It would be cool if they made a remake of this with some sort of scifi explanation at the end. Try to keep the eerie mystery about it though. I'm going there soon for the last day of school camp I'm scared !!! I've been. I'm always scared i just got home from trekking the Hanging Rock Summit... it has amazing views and theres so many rocks you want to explore. But some areas have a real eerie feeling to them. Maybe it was just me, but it pays to be with a group of people.. :) I Watched this In 2012 and i'm here in 2017 watching Again lolz I agree Miranda (or should i say Anne Lambert) was so damn beautiful.Its depressing to see her now, but she still looks amazing lol Great little movie. Can anybody recommend me some other movies like this...some period movie or movie set in rural areas, great cinematography and with great script. Mis you Miranda always!!! love to get this movie I was up on the rock about 6 years ago and somebody moved the car park sign to point towards the back of the rock. It was quite an unnerving experience to feel lost up there. I remember watching this when i was at a boarding school 19 years ago. interesting mystery. A beuatiful film. For a piano transcription plus a recreation of the original film-score music for the Ascent theme please visit: v=uLbKqqILBD8 i saw this movie as a kid. Then when one day when i was 10 my  mum told me we were going to have a picnic at hanging rock and i was a little bit freaked out to be honest. but its a really nice place and i came home safely...but it is dangerous if your not careful ive been there before a couple of times and it did feel kinda creepy tho, i mean i dont believe in the story but the way it is explained on the information signs is pretty dark and i'm  like Miranda's age so.. The meaning of this movie is not quite dark tho. Just watched this again last night...totally mesmerizing.  In the book the two boys are lovers however and agree to meet in another town at the end of the story. like  peter weir and the sequel Posse this is a good movie. simple as that. watch it. 1:24 REMOVE THIS HARLOTRY FROM HERE !!!! IMMEDIATELY !!!! PFU !!!!
Psychic Killer 	i saw this movie hears ago, as a junior high school kid, on afternoon TV. A very gross traumatic scene involving a person caught in an embalming chamber, haunts me even to write about it. rated pg?
Queen of the Stardust Ballroom 	Hal Prince said, give me an actor who can sing a little, over a singer who can act a little any day.  I think Ms. Stapleton's "singing"  is too little. I remember this movie so well; what a great work. Can't there be a channel that would show old classic made-for-tv movies like this? I never understood this about married couples, please forgive me, but in nearly all cases, one of the spouses DOES die first. (I mean, the only exceptions are murder-suicides, mutual suicides, or tragic accidents). When two people enter into a union, both must be prepared for spending at least a good number of years alone. Tragically, in this day and age, most children could care less about their aging and lonely parents, thus exacerbating the problem. I suppose this was one of the reasons why I never crossed the line into marriage. I literally have seen too much heartbreak among both family and friends. I love it when she's in San Francisco, and her son is genuinely trying to show her a nice time, but then totally understanding when she says she wants to go home. Something's wrong with the home video market when every stinking piece of crap of Adam Sandler, David Spade and Will Ferrell turned out can be had instantly but you can't buy matchless quality like _Queen Of The Stardust Ballroom_. I hope someone would upload the entirety of this movie..tnx Simply one the finest actresses from this country (USA.). She never failed to move an audience.The other one is GeraldinePage.You can see them in the same movie - Woody Allen's:Interiors"Brilliance. Thanks for posting this.  Like several other people who have posted comments, I saw this movie in the 70s and just loved it, such a bittersweet movie. I've been waiting decades to see it again. The theme music has been in my head for years! Wish I could see the whole movie again. Could you post the entire movie or upload it to Videobam -- putlocker?  Thank you.  I have been waiting 30 years to see this movie again and haven't found it.  Thanks for sharing...  wow, shes Magnificent. I saw this when it was originally shown - should rent and watch it again.  It was wonderful.  Thanks for posting. @ladyvestapattywhack Yes, the 16mm print is indeed special. I was not sure if I was going to be the high bidder. But I did get it. I think the description about the print color shifting a bit scared some people off. But it had very little use at the tv station and I would say the 16mm film print is near mint to mint in condition.  @ladyvestapattywhack Yes, she lived an incredible life. Some of the book is a bit salty but that goes along with a career. The first time I saw Maureen was in 1970 in Airport. Her performance was so superb and she was nominated for best supporting actress. When she wandered through the airport in a daze after she realized what her husband had done was quite moving. .  .  @tompennock That is so funny about her book being signed to another Tom!  How cool that you have a 16mm print of the film.  I have the DVD.  Love Maureen Stapleton in everything she did and should read her autobiography...it must be interesting. @ladyvestapattywhack Hi:Yes, I will visit your channel. I was very lucky to get the 16mm print of this movie. It's not on a low fade film stock and is warming a bit. But it was only $50.00 and makes quite an impression when this tv movie is projected onto my screen. I bought Maureen Stapletons autobiography and it was excellent reading. Plus what was really nice is that it is a signed copy to another Tom so that made the book even more special to me! .Best, Tom  .  @tompennock Yes, even the small roles in this movie were memorable. Most people don't know much about Charlotte Rae outside of her later (Facts of Life sitcom) work.  I am a big fan, as you can see if you visit my channel.  @ladyvestapattywhack I was not aware that Charlotte Rae was nominated. It is indeed a very beautiful film. During that time period there were quality made for tv movies like this. TV sure has changed. I thought very highly of Maureen Stapleton. She was so natural and so talented in this movie. I remember watching it with my Mom in 1975. Fantastic! @tompennock I agree. I also believe Charlotte Rae should have won--she was nominated- for best supporting actress for this role.  @hoovrbrt Excellent cast all around-- the "Sister" character was none other than Charlotte Rae (earlier of Broadway and Cabaret fame, later of Different Strokes and Facts of Life fame...). She earned an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Stardust Ballroom. Hi there, In fact, a musical did exist called "Ballroom", which lyrics by Marilyn & Alan Bergman. The original Broadway show starred Dorothy Loudon in Maureen's part. The soundtrack is rare but available, and it's great. Slightly different from the songs used in the film. This is one of my favourite movies. Maureen was amazing.
Race with the Devil 	The town of sandy hook in Connecticut is all devil worshippers. Look into that towns history and you'll find all kind of creepy stuff. Lara Parker (Kelly) is in the pilot Episode of The Incredible Hulk as David Banner's wife, Laura at the beginning of the show. Trivia for those who don't know. The car chase scenes I thought were better then car chases in James Bond, Fast and Furious and even The Blues Brothers films. Innocent couples on vacation and on the run after witnessing a murder. I found myself cheering for Peter Fonda using a cool head killing of satanists. Snakes can make any film frightening much as any satanic cult....SPOILER...The ending of the film is left to the imagination. Wherever the vacationers look, Devil Worshippers everywhere. York nebaska,and nothing you could do,we like colorado so what, go back to cant chill berkowits land,and find a real piece of work,44 style. just seeing the trailer gets my heart racing. this is what you call a horror movie, this crapsman now is comedy, it's so "over effects" and just t&a 1:14 it's part of the crashing sound from "Driver: You Are The Wheelman"!! It's my all-time #1 FAVORITE crashing sound!! So far, these are ALL the titles I have actually found it in:1. Vanishing Point (1971)2. M*A*S*H (1972-1983)3. The Poseidon Adventure (1972)4. The Last American Hero (1973)5. The Seven-Ups (1973)6. 99 and 44/100% Dead (1974)(heard in trailer at least)7. The Towering Inferno (1974)8. Race With The Devil (1975)(heard in trailer at least)9. The French Connection II (1975)10. Cannonball (1976)11. Silver Streak (1976)(heard in trailer at least)12. Smokey & the Bandit (1977)(heard in trailer but NOT the final film)13. The Driver (1978)14. Hooper (1978)15. The Hunter (1980)(heard in trailer at least)16. Eyewitness (1981)(heard in trailer but NOT the final film)17. Mischief (1985)I'm STILL looking for a complete list of movies that actually contain this particular sound byte, but since I can't find one, I'm resorting to going from movie to movie looking for it. If anybody reading this comment here knows of any more movies that are NOT on this list and contains this sound byte, PLEASE reply. Thank you very much. I watched this as a child and it not only terrified me but effed me up for life. OMG! I still get nightmares from the suprise ending/climax! And what made it more creepier was the camera stopping, everyone freezing, going suddenly silent, and the credits roll in! (SPOILER) Brilliant film in so many ways My daughter and I watch this movie in the backyard in the dark once a year! I heard they were planning a remake, I hope so, a great look at 70's "B' movie production!! This is the best worst movie of all time!  Every time this movie is on I have to watch it not because it is a good movie but because it is so bad that it is good!  Twister is the more modern version of the horrible movie that you can't stop watching because it is so bad it is good!  And Vincent Marro if I played your drinking game I would die of alcohol poisoning LOL!!!!!! "When you race with the devil, you better be faster than hell". Ha! Love it! great film one of my all time favorites I remember seeing this in the theater in Hollywood on a date back in the 70's.  Great movie. everytime i see the scene were the couples drive to the Gas station i wonder who was the guy in the tow truck someone said it looked a lot like clint eastwood or maybe am wrong 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88 with the fairly new " McQ " cannon installed for the multi rollover scene . Have a shot everytime Peter Fonda says terrific. super fun ....love this movie. .. full movie please
Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins 	I love these low budget 70's movies
Rattlers 	What the fuck https://dvds-from-germany.com/products/rattlers-1976-uncut-dvd
The Reincarnation of Peter Proud 	Another movie as good as this one is The Eyes of Laura Mars I remember this from when I was in high school.  I love that 1937 Cord.$16,000. I wish it was that much these days. One of my favorite movies, the pool scene where Marcia hears Peter's dream is awesome.  Commenters here take it too seriously.  Relax, have a drink, tap the glass and enjoy it. edgar cayce was cited several times. who has parents here who read hella ed cayce books like my dad? whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,,, i loved it.............................. Thanks for posting, I first saw this on TV when I was around 10, I find myself thinking about this movie from time to time, great to see it again. Saw this movie when it first came out.  Not as good as I remember it, but still interesting.  However,  I have to say that Cornelia Sharpe (Nora) has to be one of the worst actresses ever. Solid film, great score by Jerry Goldsmith.   Thank you. This is worse than I remember... yes, remember both the book and movie back in high school...damn, feels like a lifetime ago...great reading especially Book was much better.... Good one! I GREW UP IN SPRINGFIELD MASS, WEIRD, RECOGNIZING ALL THE LANDMARKS   WHERE A LOT OF THE MOVIE WAS FILMED Paddle to his balls ouch I haven't seen this movie since it came out 41 years ago . This is Lori Bach.  DeJa Vu is not all "in your head".  We've all reincarnated/done this before and the merry-go-round just keeps going and going until we fulfill our karmic destiny.  I was only 7 years old when this film came out and remembered the title but never saw the movie.  The movie title just "popped" into my head last night.  Uncanny, isn't it? My mom introduced me to this film when I got a little older (I was born in '72)... I fell in-love with it! I still love it today!! :) Shouldn't the proper title be, The Reincarnation of Jeff Curtis? I watched this in 1976... have remembered this story since then & thought about it many times... just watched & enjoyed it all over again!  Thank you for sharing it!
Report to the Commissioner 	Wockawocka Yaphet Kotto was excellent in the movie. Capt. D'Angelo disliked this video!!! Hey man ,post the club scene How were you able to get this quality? a film that had it almost all - and a beautiful naked susan blakeley Now streaming on Red Box instant. best move ever
Return to Macon County 	I believe a kindergartner painted those flames!! Must have been 8.7 min.!!
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 	yea this trailer is garbage. which is weird because the movie is great This movie was just really weird and bizarre. I just couldn't get into it. 20th Century Fox should be ashamed of the way they handled the release of this film. After Phantom of the Paradise bombed during its theatrical release, 20th would've shut down Rocky Horror had it not have already been well into production. Then, upon release, Fox spent no money trying to get it out there and all but buried it. Luckily, someone on the team suggested it be played at midnight and the rest is history, thanks to the strength of the film and ZERO thanks to Fox. In fact, after RH's success, Fox had the audacity to demand an unprecedented 80% of each ticket from theatres. They invested as little as they could in the film and took a greedy share of the credit and gross. I'm just grateful that Phantom of the Paradise and Rocky Horror slipped through in the first place - two of my all time favourite films. One of the best i am so grateful this is still in some theaters Wow, I'm so glad I didn't see this trailer back before I saw the movie, so many spoilers. guess what I'm gonna do for halloween! Is that Patricia talking or just her lips moving? aren't they using the Rocky Horror Show version of the time warp? strange. hmm if they make a remake why don't they do it the like in the old one there is a male transgender and in the new one is a female transgender? fix it!!! I saw this once, and wasn't a big fan of it -- maybe it was the hype/popularity that made me have higher expectations, or maybe it was just too sexual for my taste? The soundtrack's great, though! I'm also willing to give it another chance with the upcoming remake this year. if and when we discover life on another planet one day - what if this is it?  OMG!!!! A thoroughly unique one of a kind classic that celebrates life and it's diversities . Great fun! And if u have not seen it then go and just let loose! Simply open your minds for 2 hours to really enjoy  the wonderful fun loving freedom of these characters/creatures and souls. So... who's gonna watch it before the shitty remake starts? I'll do it, popcorn and pizza, who's in? TRAILER ERROR! Susan Sarandon's last name is misspelled as Saradon. Watching this to cleanse myself after watching the remake trailer lots of spoilers I love how Susan Sarandon's last name is misspelled at the end! LMAO! This film is a classic. Although most people may not agree that this picture is politically correct in today's society it opened a different view of the world at the time of release and still does today. And I don't know many people who aren't a fan of Meatloaf. They just don't have the guts to make films like this these days. I am offened it's not transsexual it's transgender... i wanna bycott this movie... I'd like to rewrite the ending to that movie. Didnt much like the way it ended.
Rollerball Rollin' 	by Limp Bizkit nothing comapred to the original ..goddamn bullshit rollerball con James Caan es la mejor...siempre. Looks total shite i whant to see the fuckyn movie Come on, where is the real trailer. Come on.I mean, really.Who edited this ? A blind, epilectic, parkinson's 4 years old riding a jet ski ? This is even worse than nowaday's trailers, which is saying something. i have saw another film like this rollerball but i dnt remeber what is that name Why oh why would they re-make Rollerball. Jesus... How dare they ruin this once great movie!1975 all day!
Rooster Cogburn 	What dickhead in the film industry thought it was feasible for her to be the daughter, they should have been husband and wife not father and daughter. MY FAVERIOUT awsome love it Einer seiner besten Filme von John Wayne. rooster cogburn  hehehee love him love u john wayne What a great movie I grew up watching John Wayne Movies with my Dad boy I miss the good old days great sequel to the great film true grit.john wayne did such a great acting job playing rooster.the character was outstanding.he was funny, tough and knew how to get the job done.he should have won an award for this film too,and should have won way more than he did.he did so many great films over his long and great career. @lambjack1 Hanoi Jane isn't fit to scrape dog crap off Katherine Hepburn's shoes. Great to see the duke in action. how weird
Rosebud jew propaganda 	This horror fiction might occurr to be boring to some. I appreciate it very much though. The authentic quality is amazing Who's narrating this trailer, anyway; judging by that foreign accent I think he's Claude DAUPHIN or Raf VALLONE. (I don't exactly know both of their voices.) I can't seem to find this on a DVD anywhere One of Otto's horrible late efforts. Kim Cattrall's first movie appearance...
Royal Flash 	Mc Donald Frazer did the screen ply. An hilarious film. I've been trying to work out how he mounts the horse for years. im reading this book at the moment , i never knew it was a film as well . What a rubbish trailer.. This film deserves much better Richard Lester is one of most greatest filmmakers.
The Runaway Barge 	First girls to rock ? um, nope. I hate how this trailer completely focused on Kristen and Dakota... Like, I know they were the main actresses (unfortunately), but the other girls did great and deserved some credit, especially Scout... Taylor momsen would've been a better Cherie but Dakota did an amazing job as well. Not being able to include the majority of the Runaways music because of the threat of a lawsuit......Including music in the trailer from Joan's solo career after the Runaways broke up (What's up with that) .....pretty much blowing off all  members of the band with the exception of Joan and Cherie....and not even dedicating the film to the late Sandy West who passed away before the films release. Sorry kids...this film was a major letdown to all old school fans of the band. Just my opinion folks. omg see the runaway parody because hilly is joan jett thier she looks like kristen too Think it's worth mentioning also how awesome the actress who plays Lita looks. Her hair and how she acts on stage is awesome. omg kristen and Dakota very cool.....I love this movie and the runaways they need to do one about kiss man what a movie! i love it 0 :34? song at 0.34??? And Crimson and clover is by tommy James and the shondells Joan Jett did a cover version This movie sucks it's no where near truthfull more bullshit from hollywierd i love this movie Kristen Stewart has definitely taken the 'rebellious teen' and completely ran with it! She could play this role effortlessly for daaaaays. dude I fuckin love this movie Dakota did a good job as Cherie, but I would prefer Taylor Momsen. She is basically the Cherie Currie of this generation I love this movie
Russian Roulette 	The Storyline was fucking amazing but because of the shitty actors  it was a missed opportunity The movie was good but i don't think mobsters have ever gambled on sick shit like this lol. Black widow mafia label on the lamp Eddie bravo brought me here lol Joe Rogan.eddie bravo jason baba boynumuza dola Shot out to don the predator frye siktir goteveren gela babluani super good movie, altough not perfect :)
Satan's Triangle 	I was 12 when this first aired & yes this gave me nightmares after seeing this because you really did not expect this ending, one of the best shock endings of all-time & even 40 years later still creepy as hell. I remember I was so terrified by the devilish smile of Kim Novak that I ran away from the television room and missed the last seconds of the movie. thanks to have cut at the most interesting moment.. OMG!!!  I clearly remember watching this movie back in the mid '70's and the ending scared the sh*t out of me....to this day I get chills!! OMG   It all came flooding back just with her face...the smile ARGH.  This movie scared the shit out of me.    I looked it up because I remembered my Dad used to have it on VHS tape and was looking for the name to see if the DVD was around for a present for him..now I've reopened childhood trauma. Fab.Thanks for posting...sort of thanks.. Can somebody tell me what happend? I didn't watch it to the end, coz im only 13 :S I was also 9 years old when I saw this movie. It gave me nightmares for years! My Dad was pissed at my older sisters for letting me watch it with them! @eze417 This was another one at the time frightened the shit outta me. Last story from Dead Of Night, made by the same director who made Trilogy Of TerrorDead Of Night (1977) P4can't remember who posted it @eze417 This was another one at the time frightened the shit outta me. Last story from Dead Of Night, made by the same director who made Trilogy Of TerrorDead Of Night (1977) P4 @vardiss22 Oh, yeah, I totally forgot her.  I also saw Trilogy of Terror as a child and was horrified by that last scene.  I'm going to have to wait until daylight and work up the nerve to watch it again.  Thanks. They did mate. Can I recommend U a classic 70's TV movie? Dead Of Night. 3 short stories.. 3rd one is the one :-) That's another one that made an impact. kingligger, I'm only one year older than you, and it still gives me chills.  They just knew how to make scary movies back then, and you don't see many like them anymore.  Somewhere along the line  it became about the maniac chasing people with a machete, axe, butcher knife, chainsaw, or whatever.  Any bozo could do that.  Today it's all about the cheap scare instead of true horror. Yeah eze417. That smile is pure evil. I had to turn ot off when I was about 10 lol. I've got a copy of the movie now, so have managed to watch it to the end. How brave for a 45 yr old lmao This was the first time that I remember seeing Kim Novak in a movie. That evil smile of hers....oh dear God....only Florence Marly in "Queen of Blood" ties with Kim for first place on the list of scariest movie females. @kingligger Did you not see it?  I don't want to be a spoiler for people who haven't seen it yet.  So if you want to know, contact me by private message and I will tell you how it ended. @brt101  lol yeah I know what you mean. When I watched it again for the 1st time in about 30 years, I thought to myself, 'That isn't the face that I remember. The other one was much scarier' ha ! saw this when i was younger and it scared the hell out of me. hope its on dvd.  thanx for upload Um, hey, this cuts off before the creepy smile bit.  What gives?  Why not post the whole scene?  Thanks.
Shampoo 	I was born in 1987 if I try to think real hard I can remember very little from the 80s at best 89 but at a two year olds perspective it seems so weird how times change I can't imagine how much change has taken place since then i love the movie, but the ending is weird. sort of confusing and unfinished. Love this film gave me insight at 11 years old.. The Pirate Shirt! I love the seventies, although I'm surprised this film has a trailer a bit explicit like this. ARE YOU PROMOTING YOUR STAR ? RIK MARTGINO RANKS AMONG THE BEST ACTORS OF ALL TIME...GLENN GREGORY/ANNA MARIA FIORE BIANCO MANAGER/AGENT/PUBLICIST 323 850-8580 If u were around in the 70s u lived in the last of best days  of this nation.

Hal Asby was / is great - groovy, ...
Shao Lin men Wu jing 	Anybody tell me please which shaolin form is used in this movie... I'm here for Eddie ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!!! I'll have to watch this because I just find it hard to believe Nicholas Tse in a villainous role since he has such a pretty little face. i think this is really a good movie best movie ever,this change personality Good action, sad movie but very inspirational. don't be scares of the Chinese! this is such a great movie! esta muy buena la pelicula =) china i love all your movies :) The most memorable movie of this year that I've seen, I recommend this. It was unfortunate that I couldn't watch the subbed version, seems dubbed are more commonly available but it was just as sincere/enthralling. 10/10. Get Chinese directors for DC films. The stories are mediocre but an asian director will make them visually appealing. Where is Jet Li hey september 9 thats when 911 happened no friking way!!! I have to see it!!! I watched this with subtitles on netflix. This is one of the best movies I have seen... Good movie
Sharks' Treasure 	this is such good trailer. like if  Videodrome brought you here Unforgettable movie.  Pre-Jaws.  Very gritty.  Side boob.
'Sheba, Baby' 	I'm 37 I got a lot of her movies. She was sooo fine to me mmm When you're after the top ba a, peel the skin! I like that Louis Vuitton purse at the end.... YAAAAAAAAAS! "Any cat in her way is gonna get fried" When your after the top ba a you peel off the skin. Epic. louis vuitton in 1974! I'm here from Black dynamite : ) Is that Bert Convy the one seduced by Pam's tatas? You jive turkeys ! Ya can't run. It'll get you in the end. Flammin'? @MrKmikey78 true dat She has guns  cause she is on a mission the police tellls her to do that Look at all those suckas! Sheba Shayne with the Louie bag!
Shell Game 	perfect game shooter Call of Battlefield: Modern KillZone Ghosts... I will never get how much people bitch about this game. YES, Ghost in the Shell could lend itself to an awesome story-based game, but this is a really fun shooter. It's nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary, maybe, but as a HUGE Stand Alone Complex fan, it's a blast to play. I wonder if they'll add the Arise Motoko model so we can play as her. I just wish they  make a ghost in the shell game that is more like deus ex song name ? It's Free to Play, However To buy Guns Are Pricey AF. 67k for a chipset 9k to 10k for a weapon or Agent Skin outfit (That's Real Life Currency the 67k chip-set i mentioned Is the Ingame Earned Currency which is hard to get x.x all and all it's a fun game <3) Awwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That Song! God damn flashbacks :D great trailer meh game ....but still better than infinite wayware We had so much fun Playing this game xD what song? love the game, just wish it was more like the series and less war and more slow tactical team style game.. like making SWAT style entry etc.. it's basically a run and gun war game. really enjoyed playing this game como se llama la musica? guys ????? what is name of the song???
That's the Way of the World 	I totally enjoyed this movie from 1975. The music was outstanding Thanks to The Late Great Charles Stepney (The Teacher) &Maurice White (The Student) I am about to go on E-Bay to find This Movie & Soundtrack..Straight Fire!! Joy Joy Joy Everyday.. Signature Chuck Stepney we was The Great King of music arrangements unfortunately never got his recognition the deserved he passed away suddenly...Maurice White acknowledges him in the Album linear  notes..Check out Minnie Riperton (RIP) Come into my Garden arrangements Superb I'd never heard of this movie till now....wow! oK_________ I've got it. Its not great. Bad story line, bad acting. Even Keitel is still still cutting his teeth. BUT, its worth it just to see early footage of E.W.&F.! But theres only 2 concert scenes of them playing and a lot of bad movie to sit through. You'll find a lot of copies for sale at a low price on Ebay. You can get it from Amazon I would love to see this I am a big fan of Harvey Keitel and I love EW&F's music. This is a good movie, this depicts how cutthroat the music industry is. The record company places Earth, Wind, & Fire and The Pages (similar to the Carpenters) against each other. ahhh... I can just smell the crushed velvet and strawberry air freshener... Seriously though, I've gotta see this movie!  Had no idea it was a Keitel vehicle.

Sixpack Annie 	"And Stubby Kaye as Mr. Bates" Not long ago they ran this movie Id say at least 4 or 5 times during this 1 week and I watched em all cos the movie was funny and lets face it who cant resist a purdy women? And in this case we had 2.I hope it comes out on dvd soon.This movie reminds of where I live now.Real small town America.How small? We have no red lights or even a diner to eat out at.We have 1 bar and a place to fish.That,ll work. Hey!  Check out "National Safety Sheriff" Joe Higgins beginning at 2:38!  In the 1970's, Higgins worked with the National Safety Council and National Highway Safety Bureau and did public service announcements for various states (e.g., West Virginia and Florida) regarding the wearing of seat belts and also interstate highway speed limits.  He was very convincing in those TV spots!  @adasia22  go to revenge is my destiny dot com and look under "Hicksploitation".. the inspiration for Daisy Duke and The Dukes of Hazzard, the credits have the same font! Bucking I have the movie poster. Don't ask me how. "She rides to town on a _ _ _ _ ing horse?"

Someone I Touched 	5:28 Are we SURE this isn't "Mel Brooks Presents: High VD"? So Phyllis from Mary Tyler Moore Show gets Syphilis...Whoooa! So Phyllis from Mary Tyler Moore Show gets Syphilis...Whoooa! Cloris was absolutely beautiful in this movie! I can't stop replaying the opening song. When she sings, "I was in love with you" like "I was in love wi'yooo." Kills me! "Hey, you got yourself a case of VD" - Best opening line in a movie EVER!!" My handsome cousin Rick Guthrie was in this film. RIP cuz. xoxox Coincidentally, one of the guys who wrote the theme song had a brother who died of AIDS. When you get touched, you stay touched. This movie was so fabulous I cannot even describe it to you! You must watch it. It had me laughing the entire movie. You cannot go your whole life without seeing this. I especially love the VD police! its on netflix instant view.. Is this film about STDs? @wcboy1962  You can buy this movie at rare movie world wide dot com....

Welcome Home Brother Charles 	70s was a great decade for Movies. You have a Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and a Movie about a Black Man who uses his Dick to choke White People. Good Times It's under another Title,"Soul Vengeance" Epic! I think 10 n 3 means $10 for all 3 holes. Just taking an educated guess lol I want a remake, who is with me?! how does he holster his... weapon? 10 dollars for 30 mins that was alot in 73 @22centman36 No he didnt Why you say that?? Whats 10 & 3 ??
The Spiral Staircase 	It stars Dorothy McGuire, not Georgie Maguire.
The Stepford Wives 	its a shame feminism's ruined it all up !! Looks like Get Out At 1:45 was that Michael Jackson? Basically everything was perfect and wonderful before a angry feminist came and ruined everything. This trailer reveals way too much. I liked the movie, though. oh i know, why don't we just ruin the whole movie in the trailer, so no one has to actually go and pay for it The white woman version of "get out" XD I have a feeling I will be disappointed by this movie because I read the book and its supposed to be horrifying and scary, not comedy. Damn! we almost got gay republicans a plenty! GUYS, ITS CRUELLA DE VIL!!! This was directed by Fozzie Bear of ALL people?! Well this is scary as shit If you watched this trailer, you don't have to bother watching the movie. It covered all the key points AND included the best jokes. im here for Subarbiea :v Trump family Isn't that Men In Black music at the end? How were they ever legally allowed to change this into a comedy? Illuminati I thought this film was hilarious! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen
Stowaway to the Moon 	Stephen Hawking's kiddie named Microgates flying though time, space and everything that let me skip this viddie. Of course, let a kid with zero training fly a spacecraft with a sick crewman on board and the other crewmen lost on the Moon. What could possibly go wrong? I recommend this movie for the new MST3K on Netflix. Is he trying to say he has a problem with money? E.J. would have never survived re-entry. He wouldn't have been trained for the G-Forces. Kids are honest. He would have told us if they were in New Mexico or on the Moon. Cast consists of Loyd Bridges, Jeremy Slate, and others if you look up movie online, i.e. Wikipedia....btw, 'Eli ot Ejay, is a cutie..especially when the glasses are hes not wearing them ...they are wearing him if styles change, they also come bsck around. Good little family flick, but I wanted to see the hero welcome home party,  and imagine the chicks that kid got at school...... I watched this on TV back in 1975.... I was in 5th grade and the same age as E.J. --- SERIA HOLIWEED! I was 75 years old when I first saw this in the sixtes. having watched if once more here on you& me tube gave me so much vitality that I won the ball toss tournament here at the home. Fosdick Bumpmyer Phd. what an ugly kid . they do not address each other by names so I cannot look up the actors. Most of these people are probably deceased as the actors are all about 30-55 years old. That kid looks like a young bill gates. I was nine when I saw this on TV 41 years ago, and I kept thinking that nerdy boy was me! I had shaggy brown hair, even the same brown nerdy glasses and an unnatural obsession with science and the space program. I LOVED this movie then, and watching it again now has been a pure joy! I've looked for it before and never been able to find it anywhere. Thanks so much for posting it!For those who think this movie is stupid, well, I won't argue. It kinda is. It's a product of its time, and made-for-TV movies have always been pretty horrible, but this one really captured my imagination, and my few nerdy friends liked it too. Remember, being a nerd was a lonely existence in those days. It was definitely not cool. (Nowadays people actually want those glasses. Nerds like EJ and me got picked on for wearing them.) This was the nerd-boy's dream come true!Funny, I forgot how huge the Apollo capsule was inside ;) Excellent film why is it not on DVD it should be released Wayne

The Sunshine Boys 	Just saw the play with Danny deVito and Judd Hirsh at the Ahmanson Center. Great play! I'd like to see another film version of this with Alan Arkin as Willie and Mel Brooks as Al.  The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies ever made.  ENTERRRRRRR! I LOVE this movie.
Sweet Hostage 	Love that Sweet face (Linda Blair) I <3 Mrtin Sheen, he's so awesome and sexy ;) ;)
Take a Hard Ride 	I like the equality I see in this movie too. P.S. the racial and color blending that is. great moive well i enojyed it, i wanted to see this film for a long time finnally did yesterday. fred the hammer williamson is good in his role i know he said he hated his role in this film. but ithought he did a good job. jim kelly rip great as the mute indian, he does martial arts in a western why not. jim brown i thought was the best in this as pike just looks cool in the role. huge fan of all 3 of the main heroes in this film. lee van cleef did ok in his role but i think he did not get to do enough in his role. i would of said the director was a dick to him. cause it fealt he did not have any freedom in his part. overall i give this 8 out of 10. R.I.P Jim Kelly Lee Van Cleef is a legend Jim Kelly, Jim Brown, Fred Williamson, and Lee Van Cleef? Wow, amazing cast.
Three Days of the Condor 	What a masterpiece 19.08.2016 today is birthdate of Robert Redford. The best movie of Robert Redford is "Three days of the Condor", 2th - "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", 3th - "Up close& personal" Movie reference 70',,CIA.....under Condor.. Jesus christ does Brat Pitt resemble him.
Tommy 	mitt namn(: Kommer Tommy hem? Ola kommer hem, eftersom jag kommer tillbaka till Sverige for att halsa pa. Sa passa er javligt noga ;) Lykke Li! Jag kom hinkar Kreygasm this movie looks great. I just wanna see Lykki Li ! 5 seconds in.. this looks fucking sick TokTompa kommer liks! Nu ska faaen Passarej asshu! GOTTA C THIS!!!  Lykke Li!
Trilogy of Terror 	Hillary Clinton! She won't go away.. If I first got this little shit as a gift, I would have burned this little shit in a bonfire, then walk off. wtf Double toasted brought me here
The UFO Incident 	There's no way this film is an 8/10! It is truly aweful and robbed me of time I will never get back. In fact I begrudge the time it takes to write this! I love found footage movies. They're my fave. But this looks like total shit tbh Straight to DVD... oh yes it was lol anyone else feel this would make a great p.t. style survival horror game? This is how disinformation works, the real incident had nothing to do with this shit film dark skies is the only decent horror alien film also a good none horror film with UFO and alien is close encounters of the third kind but this rendalshem Forrest incident was a hoax never was a real UFO Can't be real as it's in England not America where it all happens To be honest most of the movie I thought was pretty good. It was just the ending with the bunker that let it all down This crap delegitimizes the real Rendlesham incident. I think I'll give this film a big fat pass thanks. Forests are not that big in Britain.  I've not been to this forest but walking in a straight line for an hour in Britain would take you out a forest.  To make a good film - it for you should have just three things -this is the filmscript, the filmscript and the filmscript.Good luck in a work! ufo...........american idiots The truth is finally revealed lolThe Made Up Story Of Some Nutters I Finally Put On Screen To Cash In.... more like! Wow, i hope nobody will watch this shit. I have been to Rendelsham Forest pretty creepy place. Was looking forward to this film but its pretty shit to be honest. Man this is bad, one of the best UFO cases turned into a hype-fest. Worst thing is, the people that actually encountered the unknown craft got sick. They are dealing with radiation poisoning/sickness. But they can't access their own medical records for treatment, because it's classified.I don't know what the recent developments are of this specific case. But some issues still remain unsolved. Not to mention the mass-ignorance of the media. Seen this and its garbage BOOK TICKETS NOW or Ipswich Film Theatre at 7.30pm on Sunday 8th February followed by Q&A with Director, Daniel Simpson. Telephone bookings during office hours only 07884 076950
The Ultimate Warrior 	it looks garbage all that matters are 2 words. YUL BRYNNER. He was the man. Top movie :) Spoiler alert in the trailer... I loved this movie when I saw it as a kid. Glad I didn't see this trailer first. This movie was really good! The people are using clothes by year1975 in 2012! It's pretty awesome. Surprisingly violent at times, with a great cast! Definitely scope it out! This was amazing back then. this movie looks amazing. lol. a must see.
W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings 	Thank you for sharing, Western John!! I've been looking for this flick for a long time. Wonderful!!! I saw this when It first came out it I  was a kid I just watched again today I love this movie LOVE this film. Art Carney at his late career best. Gem! Thanks for sharing this obscure delight. Fans of the movie, read the book and shout a big FU to Hollywood. We shall all eat of thy good chicken. Thanks for uploading. Wish this would be released on DVD, there are a million movies available to buy that are not as good as this one. One of my favorites. American made ww total 50s shite I knew Jerry could write a better song than ole Country Bull lol. 12:23 Hal Needham who directed Smokey and the Bandit. 57:28 The girl from Hee Haw. That's All!!!   And one of my favorite moments of the movie with the music in the background playing 1:14:50. Hal Needham asked Jerry Reed to write the music for Smokey And The Bandit and this is another example of great songwriting. 1:27:18The Director for this movie went on to direct the Original Rocky Movie. This is my favorite of all of Burt Reynolds' movies. This one was the perfect vehicle for him and the casting and background is perfect. Ed Norton got tired of chasing W.W. and put Ralph Kramden on his tail. Thanks for the upload. Thanks so much for postin g this...It was filmed in and around Nashville,Tn......hilarious I miss the old South !  Mr. Reynolds made us proud." What are we gonna do without Burt? Definitely one of his best. The best film ever. Great movie and music ! Burt is a cool guy !
Walking Tall Part II 	"If anything ever happens to me, I want you to be sure you finish telling my story."  - Sheriff Buford Pusser. Rowan County, Kentucky today is just like McNairy County, Tennessee, way back then.
Warlock Moon 	filmed at the old sanitarium on the hill in my hometoen of livemore, Ca. still a pretty creepy place! double yikes! Classics 80s horror trailer- pause the film mid scream and let the soundtrack play on.  Classics 80s horror trailer- pause the film mid scream and let the soundtrack play on.  I see this movie is going for 80.00 with a couple days left on ebay I was at the premiere in Livermore, CA, where much of the movie was filmed. The film was held from release for a few years, because one of the producers was murdered. The high school girls in the audience screamed in horror; the problem was, though, that most of the horror in the 90 min. film is here in the trailer - not much else goes on. The movie itself is mediocre, but interesting.  I saw this movie twice on WOR-TV9 Fright Night as a child! I don't remember the whole thing to well, but it's about a murderous old hag and her sons involvement in canibalism! saw this when i was 8 and it scared the hell out of me lol. The girl in this movie is from the the tv show eight is enough! wonder when the remake will come along in which the 'heroine' will declare 'like... ummm... there's a totally uncool guy coming at us with a, like, ax. Excellent and unforgetable bizarre movie! great
White Line Fever 	"My name's Carrol Jo Hummer I come to get work" great shot that didn't make the final cut of the movie. One of my fave 70's films definitely, I still have a crush on Kay Lenz. Jan Michael-Vincent is actually going to appear at the Chiller Theatre convention this month! Filmed in and around Tucson Arizona when it was much smaller than it is now. That's a classic indeed ! I used to watch it in the early middle 80's when I was a kid , the clothing and fashion still looks so cool, I love the 70's and 80's soooooo much ! You gotta love it!
The Wild McCullochs 	And unfortunately, the trucker gets himself killed as a result of trying to race a train. This is my grandfather thank you for putting this on you tube
The Wild Party 	This show is AMAZINGLY BRILLIANT. A stage full of star performers at full throttle. New, & fresh the choreography is amazing as is the increasingly magnificent voice & presence of John Owen-Jones!
The Wind and the Lion beatuful! 	2:38look at that miss moulay el raissouni is my gran grand father thank you for the film he was a great warrior and rebel against occupation Funny, I didn't know Arab Muslims had Scottish accents. 3:33 "I am not a man to stand by and condone barbaric acts which are perpetrated against innocent women and children".Like the way the American Indian looks at him.. it shows you how WWI started. damn the resource scavengers.
You're a Good 	Sport, Charlie Brown I'm really excited that I found this DVD in the basement in our house.
Aloha, Bobby and Rose 	Finally. I was 6 yrs.old when obviously I saw this movie at a theater w/ my mom, but I always wondered why every time I heard Benny & The Jets I had a hazey memory of a VW Beetle and a couple in love, now I see it all in this trailer I loved this flick when I was 13. Ended up having a GF named Rose too....a Linda Rhonstadt look alike....although aged some. She did hold up better than Linda has though, which is a very sad story in itself.... Snake at OCIR. At least we have the memories. I saw this in Tampa, I was early teen. Kind of sad to look back on how your life flips around and you do not end up where you expected/hoped it would. I think this movie had something to do with my fascination with fast cars lol I ended up buying a '72 Stingray with a 454 Then onto a '78 Pontiac Trans AM. Those were the days :-D Milner needs a haircut! This movie had a lot of emotion attached toward how I was feeling about the younger sister of a girl I was dating. The younger sisters name was Rose - voila!. The 3 of us went to watch this movie together when it showed on the big screen in my small town of Wairoa, Hawkes Bay, NZ. This movie meant so much to me, Detroit 1975, Woodward ave, gratiot ave, was our sunset strip. The second best cruise night is every year,,the Woodward cruise is as close as it comes..I have roses autograph and photo.with movie card.Paul lemat was ,is, a very underated actor. And Dianne hull was the apitamy of the 70s look...she was and still is very beautiful...god bless the good days. Where have the good times gone!!!  I'm sure way all mis them the music the chicks the cars the fast times "TWO thums UP" They filmed some of this on Van Nuys Blvd. Great music. You're right if you lived in the Valley in 1975, this movie was a must see. Those were the days of Street races and great Drag racers too. The Snake vs the Mongoose, Shirley Muldowney, Hemi under Glass, Big Daddy etc... Great memories. Saw it in the Sepulveda Drive In. 1975. Snuck in in the trunk of my buddy's '63 Bel Air. Oh yeah! yea I was 14 at the time. Hot rod's Harley's and Lowriders.. yea Van Nuys BLVd on Wendsday nights!   I saw this movie as a senior in high school back in '75, and at the time owned a pro-built big block '68 Camaro with a black cowl induction hood and a 3/4 race cam. The movie sent chills up my spine because it somewhat reflected my life at the time. I had parked right in front of the theater, and when we came out at the end, everyone gawked at me when I jumped in, fired up that fat block, and scared the kids off the sidewalk! My "cool" index went up about 10 points that night among my friends.   I seen this movie at The Crest Drive Inn Joplin, MO. several times always loved it. The music is awesome I found it on DVD on eBay. I really didn't like the end but I can relate to all the street racing back in that era. I was 14 when this movie came out. I saw the trailer and had to see it. The music was so important at the time. Every time I hear Benny and the Jets I see the movie in my head  It's not that bad, though the ending is a bit disappointing. Why does Paul le mat get all the cool cars.... last movie I saw at the driveinn I was only 7 when this trailer was released to tv and can still remember hearing 'Bennie And The Jets' while it played...was gonna watch this but now after seeing your review i think i'll pass.
The Quest 	I've watched this movie so many times. My childhood would not have been complete without JCVD and the three ninjas lol Considering this is a JCVD movie, I fully expected it to just be another cliched fighting movie where the protagonist is placed in a difficult situation requiring he fights his way to receive some reward from a dangerous, yet completely implausible, secretive fighting tournament.  Thank God I was wrong. Roger Moore should have won an oscar for this. the fact that they havent named this movie The Golden Dragon but choose to go with The Quest is beyond science He stole this or tried to from Frank Dux after they wrote it together.... Sad Jean Calud let Hollywood destroy him with drugs. such a awesome action film star!!! What does the phrase "watch out for your tail" mean in the movie? my favourite thing about 80s trailers is the need for the narrator explaining the premise Van damme did like 9 movie based on bloodsportnlol Jesus Christ Venereal Disease Great movie buenas noches, soy Diego de Argentina quisiera saber donde puedo ver THE QUEST porque no la encuentro en ninguna pagina completa. Solo encuentro propagandas. Espero respuesta. Gracias It's my favorite JCVD movie! And one of the best of martial arts movies of all time!!! @shadowman2192 Well said ! :-) This movie flopped but God knows why, it was freakin awesome!...The martial arts was amazing the choreography was excellent and Van Damn is a great director, any action fan should love it.Definitely my favorite Van Damn movie.
21 Hours at Munich 	Just watch One Day in September doco. Much better I  was 10 years old and I remember my family watching the Olympics  and then the drama and final shock when ABC Sports announcer Jim MacKay went on the air and made the sad announcement that all the hostages had been killed. I remember watching this movie when it came on tv. Another companion movie to this is Spielbergs' Munich. This movie absolutely sucks!   Just watching the preview you can see so many historical events that were shamelessly dramatized to give the film "action."    For example, when the terrorists entered the Israeli apartments, they did not chase Yosef Romano around shooting at him.   At the airport, the police "snipers" did not have real sniper rifles with scopes nor did they just open fire on the terrorists when the helicopters first landed.   You think they could have worked a LITTLE harder at this if they were going to claim that it was accurately portraying the events at Munich? Saw this and it brought tears to my eyes. Franco Nero played that role well.
Alien Attack 	This is all fan made crap from 10 different movies.  What a joke. I HADE FAN MADE Hollywood is just wishing for something like these to happen The comming back, and this time we can not give you deal with them .but we win together, because we can survive ONLY if we are united.  we will fight the greatest battle in the history of mankind. mankind is the word becomes for us today a new meaning, we can not be divided only our little differences, we must unite to achieve a common goal,together. not to defend against tyranny, occupation or persecution but from extinction, we fight for the right to life, the right to existence.  the day when together we will win will be the day when the whole world cried with one voice: "Do not depart without protest in the silence of the night!" "We are not going to disappear without a fight!" "We are going to live on!", "We are going to survive!""We are not going to vanish without a fight!" "We are going to live on!", "We are going to survive!" I sincerely hope that these words which I wrote here is reconciled our species to prepare us for a joint fight against the common enemy that will be proof that humanity can unite in the face of a common threat. Let this victorious day is born a new era: The era of reconciliation!one earth, we survive unitedwe are one. united we survive I think if the alien comes to earth to fight we if we win there might just be a boy and a girl in this world Trump 27273646372773747488283 people will fight for the earth WHERE GOING TO LIVE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All country all people will join together to fight aliens Modern warfare 3 but aliens take over Nice Those movies have it wrong there is no way we could survive that. Any species that could travel among the stars to us would be thousands of years more advanced. They would kill us off like a bug. you just took parts from movies with aliens it's obvious anyone agree Come ON people! You look left right forwards backwards for aliens, but you don't look up or down! Seriously, you could look a few light years up and see an alien mothership dropping a megabomb on us! independents day vs battle of Los angles vs world at war vs (other alien movie) witch will win Donald Trump will protect us he will build a dome around the United States and make the aliens pay for it What movies is at 4:01 the one with the shield. and battleship fake it had a bunch of fields from different movies like War of the World, Transformers, Battle of Los Angeles ,Skyline but the trailer was good please stop with the fake movie trailers with scenes from Transformers, Battleship, Battle Los Angeles and all the rest please. Thanks
All the President's Men 	One of the worst trailers ever made haven't seen it Oh mon Dieu!! , so great , Dutch , Jewish Greetings  and Kisses from Egbert ;) :) i LOVE this movie and that its a true story just makes it better,I just watched the real reporters from this both on CNN this morning. Okay. Apparently, I slept on this one. Alan J. Pakula is no doubt one of the most overrated directors out there. If they tried remaking this movie today.. it would be a bunch of bloggers looking into an massive State Department email scandal and no one really cares. I could watch this movie a thousand times and never be bored by it.  It is simply one of the finest movies ever made IMO. Spoiler alert: it doesn't end well for the President Happy 40th Anniversary All The President's men This was a time when journalists were REAL journalists. Went out and got the REAL story. Did their own investigations. Not like it is now...Corp owned media where everything they tell you is a LIE. For the truth about anything, a person has to go online and search for it himself. Join TRUTH news websites where they don't lie like a fucking rug to you. Is this a true story? those 3 did it to push Nixon out of office Nixon was not involved-it was all John Dean and Haig and the CIA Trailer should represent the best of the movie or not? This one looks boring :( Wtf why is the security guard white, the real guy was black! i never thought Nixon was a bad guy!
Allegro non troppo 	You know what would be great, if Allegro Non Troppo had a DVD or Blu-ray release in the UK! Because it did at one point, being a rare VHS (Video Tape) release and I can't track it down, I really want to see this film without importing a US copy and spending a lot of money on a all region player. I want to buy it in a shop or on line for educational use to study animation.SO PLEASE RELEASE IT IN THE UK PLEASE! This movie is great. It made me create my own version of Fantasia. If You can create a film honoring Fantasia, so can I. :) song? It drives me crazy that this masterpiece is not available on Blu-Ray (BD) or at least DVD in the USA on region code 1.I shared the movie with so mny friends which want a copy as well.Are there any legal reasons or just a lack of a distributor? I love this film and I wish I can order it in America donde puedo bajar la peli I loved seeing this as a young adult. It was at a junior college that was showing offbeat animated films back in 1980, and loved it so much. I had never seen Fantasia, and after this I never wanted to. I used to watch this movie over and over again as a kid, and it had such a huge cultural impact on me! Allegro non Troppo really gave me my introduction to classical music, which created a love that has increased over the years. Your animation is awesome! This needs a blu-ray release! I'm sure plenty in the studio did. Maybe....but I know they liked it...:)))) The film not endorsed by Mr. Prisney! Thanks Nick !! This is one of my favorite films and I've only been able to watch it on YouTube. I have Allegro Non Troppo on RCA Columbia Home Video release on vhs No doubt the iron fist of the "Prisney Corporation" will try to stop you guys!
The Amazing Dobermans 	Why were the trailers so shitty back then? I am a Doberman lover and I love it okay the best trailer 1:37 - An uncredited Mary Tyler Moore? I have a Doberman. Now where's the nearest  bank Social acceptance has changed drasically they need it for the dog biscuit what the fuck lmao je Pau regarder le filme The Doberman Gang (1972) Simplesmente muito bom esse filme, pena que esse nao e" dublado "They were known as man's best friend . . . or public enemy number one!" you can carry some doggys like this for search in dakotas,are less dumbs like them agents land of abundance Reservoir Dogs? Except the classics, that are well known, 70's movies were so bad that this movie was actually good at the time.   They should rob a bank with hamsters talk about a slow getaway So this is what Cesar Millan is talking about. where can i find this movie online? please help
Assault on Precinct 13 	The trailer is the whole movie in 2:30 seconds Muy muy, pero muy buena. "LA PELICULA" ***** Right after the car crash noise ends at 2:20, insert Pablo Francisco's voice; "little Tortilla Boy!"(parody movie title) damn I looked for this movie for a long time hahah first and only
At the Earth's Core 	wow that's my homework thx teacher... Great fun and very faithful to the source material. Miss these kind of flicks. Here is some perspective. This came out 1 year before Star Wars. Brilliant. Remember seeing this at the cinema as a 9 year old! Great upgrade from the other posted trailer. Thanks.
Baby Blue Marine 	Usually men as good looking as JMV was back in the 70's are gay, but he isn't, AND he was built like an olympic athlete. I can only imagine how much pussy he used to get back then.  Such a shame the toll alcohol and cocaine took on him over the years. Bullshit to the copyrights,, if that were so true wildman23, then everything on YouTube would betaken down before now. There are other good movies on here that Jan-Michael Vincent did in his70's,early 80's heyday before his problems started. this still is a classic movie..one user had this posted but he had to take it down maybe it cause of the copyrights...need to watch this movie again it's one of Michael Vincent best acting in movies. @GUNNISONDUDE   guess they took it down That guy punched by JMV was John Calvin who appeared with him again twice in Airwolf. Love all the JMV clips! Sure would like to see the rest of this movie posted, if possible. Jan looks great as always. Love and health to Jan. Nicely done.  Jan may have telegraphed that punch all over the place, but boy it looks impressive.  Enjoyed the clip. cool scene, thanks for posting it
Baker's Hawk 	Wow! Cool find! I worked on the set out at Sun Dance as a hairdresser doing hair for all the walk-on's. A fun experience! Thanks Theo...it seems like every day i find more great clips of our "Big Guy"...it's like a treasure hunt,but better than finding gold!! Ban jin ba liang @ 0:37 when he sings the hook, the girls should have said 'woo woo' to sound more like the original version @illyoacademy i dont think so but he should sweet ! cool man!!!!!

The Bingo Long Traveling 	All-Stars & Motor Kings Great movie! Woohoo, that's going WAY back
Black Samurai 	Nice trailer. It's a shame that this movie cannot be found in it's uncensored form. so many 1970's flicks are cut for their re-issue on dvd. Wtf is up with that? R.ip Alright i've seen the movie wiht this
Black Shampoo 	who would win in a fight, black shampoo or black dynamite? bitch niggaz like artie get thrown out windows im like a mr johnathan women beg me to do them ..dudes beg me not to kill them...they call me mr ronathan I saw this movie once on VHS in 1995.

I'm sorry, but me and my friends would watch this movie and die laughing...there's nothing like this movie anywhere else... i Love this :-) Where can I find this movie? The best movie ever lol Ewwww Anyone saw the dik at 0:33 and the nod at 0:51 A woman entices, a chainsaw slices. I wish they still made trailers like this but there are so many more reasons why they shouldn't and don't anymore;) "When you're in the mood for something unbearably STUPID,see Black Shampoo"! I think I need some "Black Shampoo"    "Men cant get him off there back.""Women cant get him out of there hair, his Black Shampoo." Black Dynamite directed me here. I can't be the only one. Thanks for the upload! Funky ass shit nigga
The Blank Generation 	0:44 Who is she? Epic *-* johnny thunders..... the deadboys???? OMG, Richard Hell is so fucking yummy. @perforationproblems       Tuff Darts song is Fun City ! @perforationproblems It's "Real Good Time Together", cover version of the song by Lou Reed/Velvets. Patti Smith Group never recorded it in studio, but you can find a live version on "Teenage Perversity" bootleg @rainbowbroo Hell actually wrote Blank Generation while he was still with Television and performed it a few times with The Heartbreakers but the song is originally released as a track under the Voidoids name. @rainbowbroo wrong. It's the Heartbreakers. Hell was original bass player. haha ok nevermind i just saw the subtitles xD woa whos that at 0:34 ? woa whos that at 34? Of course Zobus wasn't mentioned in this...of course.  @madamesabina12 loudmouth The Heartbreakers where so badass!  0:25 song please called.'? Yay! Umm,...i mean,...yeah!
Blue Sunshine 	*it's Karen Carpenter all over again* wait that's not Sean Penn? Kathy Shaidle brought me here. I dropped a tab of Blue Sunshine for breakfast and ate The Stuff for dinner. The Horror film diet works for me! From now on I am going to follow up every statement with 'Blue.... Sunshine" Jeff Lieberman is a fuckin hack Hans Weiman loves this flick  Brilliant trailer! Great film. so its a movie about sudden baldness One of the cheesiest flicks I have ever seen! That mall disco scene had me laughing my ass off! Great stuff! Creepy, brilliant and very original...and Zalman King pulls off a great performance!!! Blues shit..sine The Best moment of Zalman King as an Actor and the Last too... ! Bath salts has never turned me psychotic and my bald patch is sadly down to inherited genetics "It could happen..." It has, even recently; only now the stuff is laughingly called "bath salts." Blue Sunshine. Gee, I wonder what this film is called...
Bound for Glory 	I remember the scene when he breaks the guitar .. Stuff you should know's podcast about steadicams sent me here. kung fu man One of the best movies gracias 2 The steadicam is not stable by itself. The biggest part of the steadicam is the ISO elastic arm, without that the whole system does not work as the cameras are too heavy for the person to hold.So yes this is the first movie where it was used and the opening shot shows how Garret Brown is gentle with the system.You still need delicate hands and you have to learn the system movements so that your shot is dead centered.Greatist invention for Movie filming in decades.  The very first movie which used Steady Cam. It makes me want to see it. Too bad I've already seen it. Wasn't David Carradine in this movie 95%  of the time?    @GratefulVince  My faverit Filmakers are Akira Kurosawa , Sergio leone , Sam pechinpah, Stanly kurbrick , Sergio Corbucci, richard stanly , Guillermo del Toro, and ridley scott @dornravlin - Well I like him but a lot of people don't. To be honest I could name a lot more director's who made incredible respectable work in the 1970's and beyond - Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Sidney Lumet, Costa Gavras, Steven Spielberg (maybe), I'll think of some more. Who are your fav filmmakers? @GratefulVince  oh sorry you answrd my quesion all ready . sorry im tired .Scorses for me is hit or misse. Cimino . how is heavens gate . ive heard of its long production history and its flope but how is it @GratefulVince Thank you im amzed  you could read that. yay i to enjoy Peckinpah . they brought american cinema some respecteblty . what other american directors . do you think brought our cinema some respectibilty. and what do you think  are promicing american directors . thank you @dornravlin - I agree 100% I absolutely adore Hal Ashby. Him, Scorsese and Cimino are my fav directors of the 1970's. Though I love Peckinpah's movies from this period too, like "The Iron cross". Ashby is amazing, I see you have good taste in cinema sir @actorric24 what did you do fore bound fore glory? hal ashby was an underated director. the 70s was last  golden age fore moviein america. great storys great Cinematography.  some of my favert   movies were made in the 80s and90s but the 70s was the last gasp of american greatness thes days . good movies  are like minning fore gold must are ok producer harold leventhal---- folk movement impresario---- without him the movie would not exist
Breaking Point 	Only found it because of pay day gAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!! Great trailer. awesome Well this turned out bad what is backsound 1:48? 10% pure adrenaline he's like my Oh what's this is mind=blown it seems like old story with new stunts Payday players anyone? Pointless Break i just realized that this movie is all about buddhism and reaching nirvana aka by the 8 ordeals or in buddhism 8 fold paths? samsara being the name of the girl which is also a term in buddhism and lastly bodhi's name which is also likely to be Buddhism "BODHIsm" lol I don't care about the fucking reviews & what the damn critics have to say...still would like to see it. Good movie Did you know for all agree with this comment or not but this remake of the movie is fucked up, simple as that. Unlike the first 'Point Break' with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze were far better than the new movie because it depicts on real life events even the story is fictional than this bullshit giving money to the poor angering governments to hunt whoever responsible taking their money giving it to the poor. Stupid. Hollywood movies today aren't making good movies like before even with better CGI still the movie plots sucks as well as their young actors just don't have the feel of greatness young actors in the past had that look being great for that role the cast of the character fits them perfect for that role be convincing. There's just too bullshit. Nowadays you see people aren't buying and renting new movies Hollywood releases young actors aren't that good as the young actors in the 90s. You have to be born to be a great actor even though you may not be educated to be an actor but started a career in something else like sports so on made you so great the world like to see you more often on cinemas than on TV shows. What a shit movie!Hollywood and their directors, producers, screen writers are losing it casting actors just don't have that feel to be the character previous actors in the past were greatly known even the plot of their movies today is weird and terrible. Not worth watching whether at home or at the cinemas unless your a retard or you have no choice to watch because your retarded partner likes these crappy new movies.What Hollywood needs is to find actors have great character and base movies that make people believe the movie be a real than be fake. fu** the haters , this movie looks good i fux wit dis move e
Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson 	"While Altman's self-conscious distanciation, calling attention to the process itself, is in the tradition of Brecht's radical theater, it does leave out an important element, which was also absent from Brecht's theater. Distanciation works against the process of audience identification through which we lose our critical distance, but it also works against the sensual appeal of the form. Distanciation requires alienation from the subject, and this may be in direct contradiction to Marcuse's hope for radical art that would involve the passions of the viewer and liberate his/her sensual feelings, which are so repressed in our culture. In this regard then, Altman, in spite of his critique of the bourgeois order at the levels of both form and content, does not achieve Marcuse's subversive potential. What Altman does offer is an articulate, intelligent, but primarily intellectual critique. Unfortunately, this necessarily limits its audience, as articulate social criticism is not what people go to popular culture to experience. In removing its emotional identification, Altman cuts away the very basis of the power of film to speak directly to the feelings of the viewer. BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS is dazzling as film theory but, by its very success at distanciation, fails as radical popular art."-Buffalo Bill and the IndiansWelcome to show businessby Janey Placefrom Jump Cut, no. 23, Oct. 1980, pp. 21-22copyright Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media, 1980, 2005 Hardly. One of Altman's top four from the seventies. The others are McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nashville, and 3 Women This movie is....TERRIBLE!!!
Bugsy Malone 	Could Jodie Foster ever not act? Like was she born after the doctor said "Action!"? ....................WAT? this is still one of my favorite movies of all time Holy shit, I just had a memory from when I was a kid and googled "kids with guns that shoot eggs" because that is all I remembered, and this came up. I really think this is the movie I say when I was 6 or 7 and couldn't remember if it was real or not.I got to find the whole movie to watch. Am I the only one who thinks this movie looks fucked up? Buggy moloen is epic If only child actors today COULD ACT like they use too. Now you just throw them on Nick or Disney Channel with poop jokes or random INTERNET stupidity they rake in millions. I find it quit disturbing 0:33 what is that song? My 7th grade class did this as a musical. I was a showgirl. Good times! 3rd best gangster movie of all times after God Father II and Goodfellas Jodie Foster at her peak. Im tallulah in April eek xx Tommy guns that shoot cream pies.  That's different. We are doing this as our school musiacla! So excited!! :) love bugsy malone auditioning for blousey brown on monday lol xx
Burnt Offerings 	What a phenomenal movie!  Brilliantly written and acted by the actors.  The 20th century gave us so many incredible films with REAL stories and REAL acting with no need whatsoever for expensive special effects.  I seriously doubt we will ever see films like "Burnt Offerings" ever again.  This movie and so many others from the 20th century need to be given light again and shown on television. i wanna thank every one for there comments, i came across this by accident and once i read the comments i was so curious and it lived up to the hype :) oliver reed was sooo menacing and every so often he took me back to gladiator ahaha. karen black was also an interesting actress and the kid actor did well to say this was 40 years ago. im still watching it now with 30 mins to go. i miss horrors like  this cause its the chilling music, the dull colour and obv the great yet classic acting that makes these types of films. i would love to read more comments from people on there opinion on this film This movie really bothered me when I was a kid. The attic scene especially. Agreed on the scary as HELL part.  I saw this as a teen in the early 80's and I don't think I slept for 3 days straight.  Gave me nightmares like no film in the history of films!  Still worth watching.  Just watch it at night, in the dark.  :-) <3 Scariest Movie I've ever seen!  R SO WHAT IS THIS BEFORE THE "AMITYVILLE HORROR" CAME OUT? BIG DEAL...... Imo, this movie is way scarier than the exorcist. I watched this at the movies when it first came out and it always ,Stayed in my mind as one of the top 5 horrors of that time ,The bit where the chauffeur dragged the coffin up the stairs bump bump bump scared the shit out me great film This trailer gave me nightmares back in 77 when I saw it as a kid. I was cleaning up burnt herbs from a chicken I baked last night when this film popped into my head.... BURNT OFFERINGS.... hahaha. Had to look it up! I saw this when I was very young and it scared the heck out of me. Amazing that the trailer spoils it by giving away the end. Terrifying, when I watched it as a kid in the 70's...especially when that chauffeur  would pull up in the old car with the sunglasses smiling.....and at the end. ..when Karen Black has aged and either he jumps or is pushed out the window with their son looking up in horror... 2:09 Actor`s epic rage quite ? Now this is Scary! I just finished reading the book which was great! I want to watch this sometime! They didn't give a shit whether they spoiled it for you or not back in the 70s. This is a goldmine for gif's. Thanks! The first scary movie i ever saw !!!!! Ms Alodice was soooo scary to me I had nightmares about her grey eyes at he end!!!!!!! omg!!!!! the scariest movie to me as a kid and I still have frightful visions of the hurse driver.
Caddie 	I watched this film last night for the first time. It is based on a true story. It was directed by           Donald Crombie. I really enjoyed the film. What a great story. The film is so well cast and shot. This film really captures the characterful older parts of working class Sydney, and it's people. +Australianhunter Caddie is on tonight 30th July on Foxtel FOX Classics @ 8:35pm.  I'm glad I found this as my Mum was in this movie and wanted to watch it. Wow, what a great memory to have of him. If you've been looking for the film, you can find a link to it in the video description above. :) Theres my dad in the background at 0:27... :) I miss him RIP, Thanks for the upload, cant find this movie anywhere and at least i can see the trailer
Shatter 	Aww FUCK that law of moses bullshit!What Neal did was fucked up so divorce his ass take him to the cleaners in court.What they did to him and the woman he slept with was fucking criminal. This movie was terrible.  Just awful. the movie illustrates how when a man and a woman marry, they become one flesh. hence, adultery is as the sin of what sodomites do - namely, when a man lies down with mankind as with womankind. oops. posted to the wrong movie ...If you break the Law (of Moses) in part, you have broken it whole.what now?  Tikkun .. "picking up the pieces, and carrying on"? Just watched this movie.  So sick I can't believe I never heard of it before amazing movie... holy cow!! as gyyyrta xDDDDDD man patiko 3 go kill yourself I don't understand how this movie is so unpopular!!!! It's a masterpiece, best movie I have ever seen!!!!!!! recommended BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER FUCKING SEEN!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for spoiling the movie, jackass. Really? why? this movie is just so stupid  hahaha im doing the same thing!!! Hmm, seems like a good option.  Let me see what else is on netflix! such a good movie!! i recommend this!
Car Wash 	This was a 1977 coming attraction on HBO (then heavily referred to as Home Box Office). mo Diantre si buscaba esta movie... recuerdo cuando era un chico siempre me gustaba ver esos tipos haciendo de las suyas.. lol Wow RIP George Carlin and Richard Pryor, two great comical legends!

Carrie 	basically the whole movie i almost screeched so mant times I don't get the movie can someone please explain this version is not anything like Carrie. It should be named X-men Origins: Jean Grey = ))) because it looks like a dark super-hero rather than a horror movie. Also Chloe bears a great resemblence to Phoenix at the prom scene i love this movie ive been trying to find out if they ever won a best movie of the year does anyone know if they did? Whats this song? this movie is a horror movie but for me more look s like a sad movie O my god im a really big fan of chloe and i can tell that this movie is one of her best Holly shit! It literally spoiled the whole movie! This movie wasn't scary it made me cry Chloe is such a good actress they all go laugh at me This trailer basicly showed me the whole movie. Has anyone tried the number at 2:28? I kinda want to but I don't know who to expect if they pick up lol when u watch the New IT trailer And then u want too see all King Movie Trailers Chloe looks like 12 year old and acted in such a badass role, amazing! They filmed this at my school Who watches this in 2017? this was such a awesome movie
The Cassandra Crossing 	there should be a remake of that 1976 Crime disaster movie called "The Cassandra Crossing" and soon A disaster cold-war movie. A deadly virus and OJ Simpson on the train........they're screwed.
Chulas Fronteras 	don't be soflamer no seas soflamero jajaja me iso recordar a mis abuelos asi decian jajaj el.  maestro.  piporrooooo a que lindo raza K bonitA cansion K bonitA cansion el piporro es muy gracioso como mucho picoso mucho caliente dont nit so flamer no seas soflamero hola amigos que hacenja un dia 1 de septiembre de 2003 deja este mundo el gran piporro...animo razaa funny song, piporruix Arriba !!

Cosmic Princess 	Dam for a show only true Hardcore fans love it waa butchered into many films, back in the days. 5,000,000 light years?? How fast was that moon going?? 5,000,000?!? They never said anything like that in the TV series, did they? They are also using clips from the episode "Space Warp". Brian Blessed Rules!!!
Cria Cuervos 	The child walking the tightrope of imagination and reality; the attempt to make sense of her surroundings (Ana has no understanding of death, only of absence, and the film is essentially her coping with the absence of her mother). This along with The Spirit of The Beehive make for two of the greatest studies of the child's mind ever put to screen. Fantastische Filmkunst !! Ich bin so begeistert... por que te vas!!!!Here is where the song come from. la vi muchas veces y la puedo sgir viendo. Hi! The whole sentence is Cria cuervos y te sacaran los ojos = Raise crows and they'll peck your eyes out. Which means that you raise or help another person that turns to be ungrateful with you. It's somehow similar to "bite the hand that feeds them". For example, on Spain when a child is disrespectful with his/her parents, they say "aaayyy, cria cuervos!!". Hope it helps! Ana Torrent is fantastic. I loved her brother, Bit, too, I have hundreds of his movies.  no cabe duda que la belleza de Ana Torret es fasci te!!!!! It's not the trailer is just so vintage but current movies are just so idiotic modern... Great movie, prelep film , grande pelicula , Serbia and Spain share history, you have river ebro, and in serbia is river ibar, like iberian peninsula.  si es jeanette "porque te vas" cantante argentina
Dark August 	Why are so many trailers on YouTube now showing 5 seconds of the trailer BEFORE showing the entire trailer?As if revealing too much of the plot of movies wasn't a big enough problem nowadays, now they are ruining trailers with mini trailers? It's retarded. Hmmm, on the fence about this. Love the books. Have to see if the changes are merely cosmetic or if they're just using the name for publicity... Watch Movies: https://twitter.com/excellntmovies/status/844043536127352833 THIS MOVIE LOOKS SO SICK!!!! Am I the only one who noticed that this trailer used musical cues from "A Few Dollars More"? (Sixty Seconds To What by Ennio Morricone) for a few bullets more! artificially trying too hard to be cool, sexy and epic. What are they gonna do when they get to the bit where Susannah gets raped by a giant invisible floating demon stingray that came out of a basement in an alternate dimension?Happy Filming Sony Pictures, Good luck :) Idris Elba is the bomb it's time for him to step aside from side character lists... Idris Elba is the bomb it's time for him to step aside from side character lists... And I just can't find Matthew McConaughey menacing, in the slightest. Maybe they should've cast Glenn Fleshler (Errol Childress) instead. Now that guy, I'd be scared to meet on a dark street. At :40, IS THAT THE OVERLOOK HOTEL! we should have a "kingverse"...like MCU,DCEU and Monsterverse Is that the hotel from the shining at :30? Is it high noon? I have zero respect for Idris Elba now. when i heard what they wanted to do, i thought he has to have more respect for himself and stephen king than that. lolnope I hope this bombs. They're destroying something I love. There's nothing wrong with the story that was told across all 8 books, which I've read several times. i'm going to throw up
Dark Victory 	It was her personal favourite of all her movies Bette Davis, George Brent, Humphrey Bogart, RONALD REAGAN??? What a sad movie :,( God speed her on her way.... The sort of films that Hollywood have LONG since forgotten how to make, this classic has a proper plot as well as well-defined characters from the two leads. Humphrey Bogart should have been given more to do though but his scene with Bette Davis is great. I love Bette Davis...I watch her movies over and over
Deadbeat 	i need this film in spanish please is this like Ghost whisperer , minus the drama ? One of the dumbest shows I've ever seen ....I  LOVE it!  honestly why dont people catch on to this - its such a great show , wholesome and funny with undertones of dark humour it deserves so much more credit LOVE THIS SHOW! Season 1 and 2 was freakin' awesome! This show is the reason why i signed up for hulu and the reason why i have kept my hulu account! Tyler Labine is one of my favorite actors. I really enjoyed Reaper, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil. His acting is superb! Creative faclity 00:19 Name? So this is what Hulu offer's over Netflix? hahaha I wish Hulu was in Australia. And what is with germany? I'm already looking forward to this. Looks pretty good, thanx Xbox looks cheap but funny, might just be the trailert tho because there were some prety funny moments XD What about Ireland and the UK Could be good.  I'll give it a try.  Tyler Labine is one funny mother trucker. What about the uk? how do we unlock the early access?
Death Machines 	Hello. I wrote and directed that movie on a very small budget, but had a Hollywood special effects man to blow up the airplane and do gun shot hits. This is a good print of the movie. Last year a first-time wide-screen version was released with my director's commentary on it. This stuff is fantastic! Wish they still made em' like this. at 1:15 look at the dude casually standing there  next to a guy firing a bazooka It is dreadful. But one of those "so bad it's good films" - I love it! Someone's store dummy fell onto that car bonnet.OMG that looks so awesomely bad :)
Death at Love House 	Robert Wagner being one of HL's closest friends - what a hunk of cheese EU VI ESSE FILME ,QUANDO TINHA 17 anos .SUSPENSE E TERROR DRAMATICO.
The Disappearance of Aimee 	A real pro is just describing Faye's infamous, unprofessional behavior -- once you've dealt with irresponsible coworkers and the unnecessary grief they cause, you appreciate Bette's honesty. Embittered old hag on her last legs, resentful of Faye's youth and talent. Compare the likes of Bette Davis with her cheap tabloid theatrics to the class of Barbara Stanwyck who would NEVER talk about other professionals in the industry like this. She named all of my favorite films!      :-) Whales is infact her 83rd Theatrical release but she made 16 what made for tv movies, which at this pt. does not matter.  It all goes to dvd nowadays anyway. Not True.  James Woods backed up every thing Bette said about Faye, always late, not knowing her lines, drinking all night.  Bette always fought for a better script for the betterment of the MOVIE not herself. yeah she Bette trashes Faye Dunaway really well on the Carson show..it is on Youtube..and the interview gets really good from the 9:15 mark on..she scolds the audience first, as they were giggling when she was talking about Lillian Gish, the she goes onto her comments about Faye Dunaway, totally priceless...great interview..Kirk..Montreal, Canada Good lord do not let Bette Davis know you said she made 100 films or she will come and haunt you..lol..she  made it quite clear when she was on Carson and he mentioned that 'Whales Of August" (her film with Lillian Gish) was her 100th film..she corrected him in saying, 'even she has not lived that long to make 100 films'...she says it is more like 80 something lol...  :-) Kirk..Montreal, Canada because she had every reason to lie about her and you're not being biased at all, i'm sure Miriam Hopkins. She had an affair with her husband. Bette shakes the woman violently in the movie "Old Maid" LMAO as her husband directed the movie thanks for all the bette interviews! shes my favorite actress! Ms. Dunaway is for Ms. Dunaway!!!! She is dead on about Dunnaway! Wow! Although I adore her acting, I've heard so many people say how awful Faye Dunnaway is as a person. The vitality, wit and compassion still embodied in Bette Davis is truely amazing. I also think that this interviewer is one of the best that ever had the priviledge of asking her questions. Gary Collins asks questions that made her really delve into her life and career and her opinions on certain matters and she has to take a few moments to really seriously consider what he's asking her. Absolutely one of the best interviewers I've ever watched. Well done! And thank you for sharing this with us. I am just blown away by Miss Davis. We have seen all of her movies and she is one of our favorites. To have suffered through a radical mastectomy and a terrible stroke. She is SO vibrant. Like a young woman trapped in an old woman's body. I read that "All About Eve" originally had some other generic-sounding title, but the producer or director or whoever was reading the script, saw that line in the narration, and circled it as a much better choice.  "Margot Channing" would've been a boring title.  "All About Eve," even though the film is really All About Margot, is a name that stays with you, and probably has a lot to do with its success. Oh goodness, if they didn't give her the Oscar because of the movie's title, that would be ridiculous. Sometimes you wonder why  the best actors don't get as many Oscars as they deserve. yea but she had one of the best warner had one dramatic hollywood star in that day and it was Bette...Bette fought for parts hard difficult complex parts and she was great at it! Olivia De Havilhand said so herself. Actors were like cattle and only a few did what they wanted, Well considering she made 100 films and worked with a thousand actors, the fact that she only dissed 2 at the end of her life is fine with me.  I find it refereshing that someone in Hollywood actually spoke the Truth for a change.
Disco Godfather 	DEAD GIVEAWAY. Don Tony Brought me here Don Tony and Kevin castle show brought me here. Thumbs up if Don Tony sent you here don tony took me here and he was right that made my week remake with denzel would be marvellous. Anyone seen Keith David in any of these dancing scenes? I am putting my weight on it but nothing is happening!!! Great man, Great movie, if you havnt seen it you will laugh out loud all the way through ha ha I own this movie. Had the fortitude to watch it twice. It's an absolutely HORRIBLE movie in a serious sense but in a "there is only one" sense, it's a masterpiece. I encourage you to gather your friends, blunts & alcohol, watch this movie while putting "your weight on it"! Uh, should I be putting my weight on it? This is amazing! Vinegar Syndrome is going to be re-releasing this, Dolomite and the Human Tornado on Blu Ray next year. Hopefully this also means they will be showing up on their Streaming service Exploitation TV as well. Blackest movie ever made? Or 70s-est movie ever made? Or both? Public Enemy put their weight on it 10 years later and added mr c Hahahahahaha sounds like Rick James Sho Nuff is in this movie! 0:58 Those are some short shorts near the end of the trailer. ANGEL DUSS
Dixie Dynamite 	I saw this movie with a buddy of mine when I was 12 years old.  I still remember the two of us going on and on for a week about "Dixie's tits".  That little boob shot made one hell of an impact on two boys just approaching puberty.  LOL!!! God i LOVE this stuff!  Brings back lots of memories!  Warren Oates was just a natural for these low-budget, regional flix!  Love it! Look at 1:33 I am old enough to remember when girls used to look like that.Those Southern Belles were pretty enough to be in a Florida Orange Juice commercial.They were probalbly Nixon Girls  who went to BillyGrahm speeches. The Jerry Springer Show really loused up the image of Southern Women "Warren Oates just got stuck in the middle of it" - gee, poor Warren Oates this flick is a hoot. Am watching on Neftlix. It's like Dukes of Hazzard meets Thelma and Louise but 10x better. Warren Oates is friggin awesome. You just can't make a bad movie with Warren Oates. Is this trailer from the "42nd Street Forever: part 2" dvd? trailer's better than the movie! fucking awesome where can I get a copy?
Double Dare 	looks amazing!! I loved her on double feature movie Grindhouse. She was so excellent :] I'm glad she's getting recognition.  I love Zoe Bell! She's an awesome stuntperson and loved her in "Death Proof" holy shit xena
Dr. Black, Mr. Hyde 	All the people about to run and watch this movie be warned: the rapping dude in the trailer ain't exactly telling the truth about the movie lol wow, flash animations with less views get taken down for drawings of boobs... this managed to stay? i have no intention of flagging this but, wtf youtube logic?? lol? "Brother man, this situation is rapidly becoming insalubrious." we call this pcp That announcer was a verbal ball of slime, trying to rhyme every time. shit i wish trailers were still this black reported for nudity Okay, this is definitely going on my 'watch later' list now. Who the hell needs Netflix _or_ Hulu when you can find stuff like this for free right here? You'd never find this in either of those places! I found the first rapper! That's racist! XD LET'S BOO THIS!!!! :D LETS DO THIS!  would u like 2 see something like this in "Boondocks"? Super strong, supernatural and super bad! Fuck yeah! Nah!! He was sniffin those bath salts, man!! Fun fact: the guy who plays the policeman in this movie was the Mandinka warrior in Roots, and the policeman in Blacula was Omoro Kinte, also from Roots! This is like The Incredible Hulk except with Afrcan-American actors. I hope they remake this at some point with a more serious tone to it.  love the narrator! (01:18 - 01:21) "don't give him no sass or he's kick ur @zz" lol! Clearly therefore he's one of the Heralds of Crowleymass.
Drive-In 	U people are try keep it up. Hotline Miami How to spoil a movie in 2 minutes This is such an awesome movie, whatever I say, it will not do it justice. 16 seconds in I've made the smart choice of just watching the movie Glad I watched the movie first... There should not have been a fucking trailer for this masterpiece *Watches trailer**looks at comments*Wait, so I basically screwed up by watching the trailer before the movie? Crap. I'm so glad Drive isn't an action movie (like this trailer paints it out to be) in reality it's one of the greatest films of all time I just watched Drive and came back to let anyone know that this trailer doesn't even remotely capture the tone of the movie. Probably one of the best films I've seen to date and I firmly regret not seeing it over this abysmal trailer. Never saw it assuming it was yet another generic movie with car chases similar to fast and furious 1-23. Such was not the case. The directing, sound track, acting, etc are top tier. The supporting actors - a who's who of great actors - are excellent all around. The movie has a very film noir feel to it and the violence graphic. Sort of Good Fella's meets Miami Vice. This is a tense, taut, tight movie, that takes some time to get into. I did find the ending very unsatisfying, which feels sloppy and rushed; maybe intentional by the director, but it didn't work for me for what's an otherwise solid movie. With just a few tweaks and a better ending, could have been a classic. A-/B+ This trailer just showed the whole movie, and that too in chronological order of the scenes that takes place in the movie. Do not watch this trailer if you haven't seen this movie yet. Great movie, Terrible trailer editing. I think the trailer has 80% of Gosling's lines in it. I just came from watching the movie, this trailer is the movie in 2 minutes 30 seconds lmao I know I'm 6 years late but this is a really great movie Baby driver) Great movie. Glad i didn't watch the trailer before seeing it though. Spoils everything. I just finished watching the movie and it was really good like I was hooked right away and the soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks that I've ever heard. Gotta see film again as I thought it sucked the first time Worst trailer I have ever seen. Spoils everything. DO NOT WATCH THIS BEFORE YOU HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE MOVIE!
Drive In Massacre 	Obviously amateurish (they don't know how to spell Massacre?), but looks like some potentially interesting grindhouse quality fare...
Drum 	Estoy en mi clases de ingles This Film is better than la la land mangini is the best I can't get enough of this movie! When people call Miles a bad actor it actually makes me mad, because we have seen what he can do when he is given good stuff. It's one of the most triumphant things I have seen in terms of come back stories. I wish i had a teacher like that. it's a crime that this didn't win best picture. I love Birdman and all, but this movie is somethin else why did I cry watching the trailer? hikz... no... Only just watched it, easily the best movie I have ever seen. Absolute perfection. "Whiplash" in review: An artless douchebag acquires drumming chops after being Stockholmed by an artless, crazymaking, psychopathic douchebag.. This movie is worthless trash.. seen it like 10 times This is my favourite movie of all time but the trailer editing is appalling la mejoooor pelicula del mundooo This is an outstanding movie, like all films of it's caliber I'll take pleasure in watching it several more times to understand it as much as possible. best movie of 2015 this couls also be called 'bleed for this'... Awesome!...Acting, script, music...Awesome! Inspirational Film This moive is cool man Detective Jim Gordan needs to get back to Gotham LOOK!A FcxKing Mars bARs!
The Duchess and the Dirtwater 	Fox Central City, Colorado. Under-rated film. Simple and good fun.
The Eagle Has Landed 	Best Double Crossing Model Polish Disguise! Yes the Mussolini Mountain Prison Part was True and those German Special Forces had been awarded the Highest Iron Cross. Directed by John Sturges Starring Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland Made by ITF  Entertainment the eagle has landed 1977 Great cast. Der DEUTSCHEN FALLSCHIRMJAGER I've read it.  One thing I remember is Molly Prior grown up with Liam Devlin's child. I wish they would have included the British traitor Harvey Preston from the book in the movie...he was quite a "thoroughgoing bastard."  Also wish there would have been a film for the sequel, "The Eagle Has Flown." Why did they want to kidnap the insurance dog? I still have a shell case from the cliff tops of North Norfolk I gained as a lad, it's a 303 & probably from an old Lee Enfield . To my knowledge not one single German Spy went undetected in Great Britain during WWII.  I love this movie! the girl fell into the river and the german paratrooper jumped in to save her which he did but then he fell into the wheel and hes german uniform got exposed and then the us army found out and killed the german paratroopers This movie was badass at that time! :D their is a special editon of the book with material not in the orginal which expands on the story and what happend to some the characters later on. This was rated "PG" at the time, and I saw my first "R" rated film -- Black Sunday -- a week later.  In my opinoin of the time, one shot of bare breasts (making Black Sunday and "R") was nothing compared to the violence of this "PG" movie (and yes, I enjoyed both, very much.  As Jack Nicholson has said, "Kiss a nipple, and it's rated 'R,' cut it off, and it's rated 'PG'").  Our priorities are screwed. just read this book last weekend!i found it at the attic.its a nice book by the way Fantastic movie,the book is even better.
Eat My Dust 	See Ron Howard wear caps and hats throughout the movie! this movie is fuckin retarded I saw this and Grand Theft Auto on a late-night movie double feature.  They're kind of blurred together into one big-ass car movie in my memory. So i was 12 and i still rember this movie love still That's the Real Don Steele narrating the trailer. Lee Van Cleef pops his clutch and tells Sho Kosugi to eat his dust!

Embryo 	The last few seconds sound like a drunken orangutan playing with an accordion, recorded on a damaged tape player. I watch this years ago. Watch again. Did they ever make part two.. About the baby she carried of his? At the end you can hear the baby cry MR. MCGEE!!! THAT'S MR. MCGEE!!!
The Enforcer 	'Harry's got a lady partner...' . Show lady partner with breasts bouncing....just to emphasise the point. This is the first time I have settled down to watch this movie in full.  The actress made me love the movie but I wish there was a happy ending that she get to go on a date with Eastwood :( you'll never find a man like this in San Francisco these days. class she wanted to play lumberjack...she couldn't learn to handle her end of the log. "I want my name to be Spaghetti."
Eraserhead 	like watching a dream that your waiting to wake up from. Its the closest I've been to a dream while being awake. A complete masterpiece tovbeler tovbesi ablamin zoruyla bunu izledigime i amiyoru Right when I saw the title I thought, how do you make a trailer for Eraserhead? Wtf Cara surrealista pacas 40 years ago this month it came out and it still freaks me the fuck out when i see it. HA! I love this movie!! That is true cinema!! how it feels to do deliriants Does this movie devil possession if because I not watching because say mother if watch devil possession film he will grab your penis and never let go so I want keep penis because penis is the valuable for promotion at work because if boss is woman boss woman grab penis and penetration equals promotion more potatoes for family equals happy wife happy boss happy childrens, happy penis. Pliz help. 2017 - Still way ahead of our time. A must-see.  A genuine treasure of the Midnight Movie avant-garde set.  A favorite. I watched this and loved it, the madness of it is what made so fascinating. gay, no tits #WatchMojoFrancais the film you must watch with your gf. lmao Like si viniste por Giordi :D
Family Plot 	Family Plot shows Alfred Hitchcock could have gone on and on making quality films if it wasn't for old age and falling health Although Hitchcock wasn't very well at this stage, the cast remarked that even in his mid 70s, Hitchcock still had an uncanny eye for detail in setting up the various scenes. What a terribly put together preview. It's not the greatest Hitchcock movie, but they still could have come up with a much better trailer. LOL! The look on Karen Black's face at 1:55 is hysterical! This was my least favorite AH movie! Dern: What do we have to do for the money?Harris: Find one man.Dern: What's his name?Harris: Nobody knows.Dern: Where is he?Harris: Nobody knows.
Fighting Mad 	@Jeff D Don't be ridiculous! Peter Fonda is the greatest american actor EVER
The First Nudie Musical 	Is this movie still around? I remember seeing it on showtime 40 years ago. why not the whole film which i think is directed by ron howard? If you click on the link in my synopsis, it will take you to Bruce Kimmel's website where you can purchase the DVD. you did a wonderful job!? it kind of a had the feel of a  criterion trailer.  Could you pm me a link to this film?? Wish Cindy Williams was nude in it??? Hysterical.  Love it. This made me smile after a rough day. Thank you for doing this.
The Flight of the Grey Wolf 	I am now pro-vajazzle It's more plausible than the story where he lived in Brazil until 1984 as a farm labourer and had a black wife. The movie where Hitler accepts meat on the plate from a waiter even though he's vegetarian. Brilliant. Idiots. i cant wait to see it. have you also seen the doc on netflix about this same subject? Hey!Is the DVD movie region free? Bart Custers. And you are an ill educated twat. Waste of time, pure fiction ES UNA VERSION DE LOS HECHOS The film is due to be released in the US and Canada on December 9th. I'm very excited for the film even though I've already seen the sequence in time of editing. Thanks for the book with your signature and also for the hospitality in Hesdin. I really appreciate the facts that you have collected for many years in Argetina and a profesional job. I't's very dificult to reopen the history of WW2 but these facts shed light on the dark side of this war. Compliments from Albania The film is now available via Amazon.co.ukhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Grey-Wolf-Escape-Adolf-Hitler/dp/B00CLDQC8I/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1400532946&sr=1-1&keywords=grey+wolf+the+escape+of+adolf+hitlerThanks for your interest. Mr Williams, when will this documentary be released? full film?? is there a full film of this? I have the book already would like to see the film in full if it exists.
Flood 	LIE! would of been a much better movie if the flood actually flooded london like in 2012 new york was flooded or in san andreas los angeles was flooded i mean that's a disaster movie and not just a small area on the thames, i wanted london to go under water damn it!!!!! i thought it was poor, too ordinary n well below par. doctor who will survive inside the tardis and harry potter will stop it with his wizard stick or something This film is so bad I was crying tears of laughter all the way of through. Actually not too bad of a movie. The film takes a long time to get into but the film is amazing and really sad x a disaster movie Worst movie i ever watch You Have Been Warned! Saw this on Syfy and was expecting a movie with a terrible plotline and effects but... I actually liked this Good actors in lacklustre film. I saw half of this movie and died of depression! Whoever thought up this story had really strange ideas. A Harry Potter fan would probably say that it's up to the wizarding world to stop it. never say never :P Well for starters this will never ever happen its not possible and well if it does nobody is safe but trust me it could never ever happen  Global warming?? Are you people joking? Have you never heard of HAARP weather weapons? Look up the UN weather weapons treaty this is all real no global warming going on. They (the elites) want you to believe that lie so you agree to the planned global carbon tax fraud. Stop being so gullible & believing mainstream media pure lies & educate yourselves on the truth. The media are ALL owned by the elites & have an agenda, they lie constantly please educate yourselves -_-  This is happening now :) 1:44 thats the queen??? its finally in europe
The Food of the Gods 	With all the remakes hollywood puts out you'll think they would remake this movie. this gotta watch lol A horror movie without cg? Brilliant!
From Noon Till Three 	Never saw the film (being as it was made 3 years before i was born); other than the comedic angle, don't really see any side of bronson i haven't seen before.
The Front 	This looks great, this is getting a nice blu ray release this month (march) here in the UK looks like it is worth picking up Actually "the front," rather "the popular front" was a term that referred to organizations that were funded by Moscow for the purpose to Communism gaining a foothold in the United States through these "front" organizations that denied getting funding and directions from the USSR.  But they followed the marching orders of the Russian Communists.  They even referred to their purpose as "colonizing" America. "The Front" is to me a movie that should be shown to many generations of Americans about a terribly dark period in history. It shows what a major problem anti-Communism was, and unfortunately, still is today. Such an underrated movie.
Futureworld Amazing 	Is the up dated Sky tv version of this with Anthony Hopkins any good? What I make of it it was weirder than WestWorld and creepier. :37is umbrella corporation runnng futureworld?   o_O old , but still good movie. Some cool ideas but this movie is just soooooo bad. The cringe is strong with this one. Blythe Danner is Gwenyth Paltrow's mother, and by far more prettier than her the 2016 West world is better it's just Jurassic park wish hbo did futureworld style instead of cowboys and injuns I've literally never heard of this movie and I loved the original Westworld. I'm stoked for this. Damn 12 hundred dollars a day isn't a very affordable price range.even for then Wow, glad I watched the movie before. This trailer spoils the entire film! Good, now we know the plot behind the Show... shit, shouldnt have watched this trailer! How do you make a futuristic world in a story that's already set in the future? Shouldn't it be called Presentworld? My review: P O S To bad the movies didn't work out where they could've done the other worlds in their own movies.   Then again the idea of the constantly opening and having massive failures might have been hard to sell.   Of course they could've set up the idea that the other movies where happening at the same time as "Westworld". I remember seeing future world on tv a long while ago, it was not as good as west world but just ok for a movie on it's own. I liked the "few" Yule Brenner segments in the movie, they should have had him in the movie more than they did like they how this trailer gave you the impression as such. I just saw the trailer for the new tv series called west world coming out on hbo, as a big fan of the original west world I am looking forward to it. There's a remake of this coming soon and staring Milla Jovovich! Can't wait. Wow the fighting game in The Island is similar to the fighting game in this film.
Gator 	Thanks, very helpful video.. in the end it's finally on.. took it off at least 6 times trying to set the height, yep messed up the front of the kids bike pretty good.. should have read the gaffer tape comment.. .. put it on a Norco fluid with 5" travel front and back.. travel still works.. although when the kids bike is not attached it slides in the bracket.. but it doesn't seem to cause any issues. just kind of odd setup.. annoying music and text over the images that matter! I have a Boardman bike. The part that should clip onto my seat stem doesn't open wide enough for me to fix it to the seat, any ideas?? could not be easier! ( sarcasm yes ) I know it says it's for towing a child's bike, but would it work for towing an empty adult bike? Great how to vid.  Easy to follow and I love the music.  My bar keeps sliding from side to side but I'm thinking I just need to tighten the bolt near my seat.  I did read the instructions in the manual but this has also helped a lot.  Thanks. You're a hero, friend. Thanks for the effort! hey can get some help pleaseeee. I've installed this as instructions show but the trailgator moves up and down, like in the video. So it's resting on my back tyre, how do I get it to stay at the right height that it keeps my daughters front wheel off the ground at the correct height. thankyou x Hi, very helpful video - thanks! However, I'm having some serious issues with mine. I've tightened everything as tight as humanly possible, but I still get a tone of lean with the kid's bike (??). There seems to be a lot of play (torsionally) in the attachment that joins the two bars together (where the locking pin is, that allows the bar to extend/shorten). Has anyone else experienced this?? Is there a solution? I'm usually pretty good with bike repair, etc.; but right now this product is completely non-functional for me and I have no idea how to fix it. the front of the bike is ruined after you remove the bracket. there really should be something provided with trail gator that correct's that Thanks this has been a big help since mine came without instructions. Thank you Thanks for the video! I didn't understand the non-use mode from the manual very helpful -especially as the official instructions are not very clear. super video merci Hi do you have a problem with your sons bike leaning to the one side when under way. Thank you so much for posting this. Bought one off eBay and no instructions. So a big thank you from my little boy who now loves being towed!
Get Mean 	Do you happen to know the name of the song that appears in all the stranger trailers?
Gizmo! 	gizmo gizmo gizzzxmoooooo i wish i had a pet mogwai The loveliest movie pet that ever was, next to Babe :D its too cute bright light classic gizmo So cute "don we now our GAY apparel" ??????????????????????????????? 1:26 sorry Gizmo but id have to kill you along with the rest of the gremlins No feeding him after midnight just don't feed it after midnight AAAAAAHHHHHH CUTENESS BURNING MY HEART Bill made have made some mistakes in raising Gizmo....but he did his best to love and nurture Gizmo and Gizmo appreciated it.

Why does this movie creep me out so much but I have never seen it before?!
The Great Houdini 	Houdini is the he is the get Houdini This movie is a prequel to the pianist where Houdini performed his greatest trick, escaping the holocaust. sucks belo
The Great Scout & Cathouse 	Thursday @jorcol66 Go to your inbox & I will post some info/links there.  It's too much of a pain in the butt to put web addresses on the Youtube comment section. @glasshalffull5490 Are you still looking for "The Great Scout & Cathouse Thursday"?  Considering that it's out of production, you may have to & or can, download it.  I found a site with multi-part links to Rapidshare.  Let me know if you want the link. @jorcol66 I found a site that has it/links to Rapidshare.  Interested? Funny as hell! can anyone upload it? I love this movie... I wish it were available in stores... I checked Amazon and a used VHS of it goes for $85 Does anyone actually have this movie on YouTube? It's not available anywhere anymore. I just caught a few minutes of this off-beat western comedy on Encore channel. Such great casting, really a reminder of how much better ensemble casts used to be. man this is one funny movie!
Grizzly 	best movie remake of Grizzly (1976)? So this movie stars Cyclops, Punisher, and Stick? I didn't know this was a Marvel movie. Lol this is 2015 noob Every horror movie shouldn't have dogs in in them because seeing dogs dye makes me cry of course the Bear acted better it's Bart. He's real and cool. Bears are amazing Just like the crappy jaws 4 You wasted both Billy Bob Throrton and Scott Glenn??? its called "Into The Grizzly Maze" fucking bear looks CGI as fuck! oh oh look out people a computer generated bear is after us, run for your lives!!! This must be a modern Remake of the 1976 classic version. Supriseeee. Animals are monsters again. Another hollywood shit shows the bears as monsters. I liked it! I like the part when that grizzly fucked billy bob up the ass and made him like it! This movie is called 'Into the Grizzly Maze" NOT "Grizzly". How can a cute animal like that kill people like this? .__.Better give him some honey and he will be pleased xD Maybe im bad with numbers...but it says 2014 >.>
The Gumball Rally Gumball 	That title only succeeds in making me HUNGRY! LOL!
Harlan County U.S.A. 	40 years later Appalachia has gone from fighting big coal companies to rallying behind a dictator promising to bring the coal industry back. I have ALWAYS been in SOLIDARITY with the American white working class workers, in particular at that time with Harlan County coal miners. It's unfortunate that today in 2011, many of our white oppressed and exploited white brothers and sisters have now become the oppressors against us Brown people of color, but thank God not all white people are racists. Fascism and racism has no borders or color barriers.  - E.F. Mohammed Martinez - In SOLIDARITY With ALL Oppressed People of America.
Harry and Walter Go to New York 	What a spirited comedy!
Hawmps! 	Thanks for the upload nice movie. I love the older ones they do bring back good memories. I saw this movie at a drive-in theater when I was 10 years old in 1976. This is the only viewable copy I found on the entire internet, so thanks +Milton Block for making that happen. Thank You Very Much! You make the world a better place. The more, the better I first saw this movie at Yosemite National Park when I was twelve.  They used to show movies in the evening in the lounge at Yosemite Lodge.  Since there was no TV reception in the valley, it was just about the only thing to do after sunset if you weren't into campfires. Funny movie. Barely based on the facts, which are amazing enough on their own, but a funny movie. Don't know why it didn't do better at the box office. 40:21 Insanely Funny!!! movie is to dark, and out of focus. why... Thanks for this. I was talking with a colleague recently and had a flashback to the bar room fight and the song playing in the background. Jeez, it's funnier than I remembered. Milton Block you make me so happy n proud too......been searching this movie for years....the film is funny n' unique......Slim Picken is legend.....brilliant.....greetings from Malaysia! Where did you find this? I have distant memory of this in the theaters. Born in 1971.
Helter Skelter 	The one and only.  The 2004 remake is pretty good, but this one is the definitive movie about the crimes. I saw this on tv in the 80's. The only movie that ever scared the shit outta me. Saw this as a little kid and it scared the hell out of me. Later when I was older I got even more frightened when I found out it was all real. I gave up trying to find the full movie online. I just bought it today from Best Buy, for $13.99. Charlie is God! 00:17-00:26: That music is still creepy after all these years. This movie looks like something I left in a toilet bowl once I Think The 1976 Helter Skelter Film Starring Steve Railsback As Manson Is The Best Portrayal Documentation Of The Manson Family The Other Side Of Madness From 1971 Portraying The Manson Case Is Pretty Cheesy Check out my movie on You Tube type in....6 Minutes the movie Yea i got the dvd, needs a blu ray release i saw this on television one weekend as a child and it scared the bejeezus out of me. this gives me chills. Dude i didn't even know they made a remake! How gay! So many times remakes are made becuse they can't come up with new ideas then they ruin the original. Most recent was Total Recall, Arnold Schwarsenegger's flick was ruined. Miracle on 34th St. Ruined. Remade twice! Shit many movies ruined What I wouldn't give for someone (with the ability) to up load the entire movie and makes sure it does not get removed, as has happened before. It pisses me off, that this CLASSIC masterpiece keeps getting taken down, while that pathetic 2004 "remake" is all over youtube. Steve Railsback scared the shit outta me in this, I wish he'd do more stuff, he really is a great actor
Hollywood Boulevard 	Wow... look at all the boobs right here on Youtube.   How? Best HB trailer- thanks for posting!!
Hollywood Man 	This and Frozen are the highest-grossing films of 2013! Top 3 reasons people want to see iron man 31. iron patriot2.hulk buster armor3. end scene(after the credits)Iron man 3 is pretty good but i prefer man of steel Let me tell you a true story about fortune cookies I don't get why people found this so bad? I saw it and I found it so good! ehhh.. it was okay... GREAT MOVIE 2:10 best scene of the movie! Then your'e not a true Iron Man fan! ladies, children, sheep. Some people call me a terrorist, i consider myself a trevorist. The Mandarin, there is no such thing. I went to see this last night. I was a pretty bomb movie. (: GOSHH TOO MUCH TOP COMMENTS you're maybe not matured enough to handle the dark knight rises movie and plot developement. get lost and play the power rangers toys dumbass Music playing in middle? This one of my favorite movies of the year, I don't care what other people say. This movie was a huge improvement over Iron Man 2.  Why so many thumbs up here? lol stark has an ARMY. fighting his is like starting a war.  is the best forever Almost every comment has a like, damn?!! Great movie though.  Mandarin was a troll This trailer still gives me chills
Hot Potato 	I came here for the wiggles Reminiscent of caper films of the 60s and 70s. The Hot potato? are you serious :)) ... and its a drama!! (What the FUCK!) Simpsons did it TPB When is the movie going to get released? Could be good ;) Any news regarding release date, please?
How to Break Up a Happy Divorce 	does jen age? There's just something about Jennifer Aniston that makes me want to punch something. Barf. that's Pete from friends He was 100 percent and she was 100 percent as is with most relationships. Usually in these movies, both the man and woman are a little wrong and a little right.  In this one, Vince Vaughn's character was totally to blame. this is like one of the worst trailer with so many big names "Polish proud" tee... :D JUST FINISHED WATCHING THIS me encanta Jennifer..!!! And by the way- the only guy who couldn't evade that fight his girlfriend was trying to start in the beginning of the movie is an idiot.  His every answer was pretty much the perfect one to only enrage her more. The movie would be better if they made Anniston's character an asshole as well.  A few funny moments but really no tension for me.  Her boyfriend was clearly a narcissistic selfish asshole and should she have broken up with her.  All the guy had to do to keep a hot awesome white bread girlfriend was clean the dishes when company comes over and keep a shopping list right and he could do that? That laugh at 1:35 - Buzz Lightyear at a tea party I'm done movie - awful A break up 90 percent the women's fault usually. Rotten tomatoes is usually on point, especially the audience ratings but they both ranked this below 50, I don't get it.......probably watched this a dozen times & still laugh every time, the only thing I could think of is sometimes when I see a movie in the theater I might not think its that good but then when I see it at home a few months later it will be a lot better & also the more u see a movie it can grow on u like some songs. She is hot . mannn even the trailer is boring where there is rachel, there is a break-up
The Human Tornado 	i gotta a dong bigger than king kong lmao 0:00 to 0:02 that tornado footage is from the wizard of oz(1939). He was boning the shit outta ole girl...lmao Holy shite!  It's Bullhorn from BLACK DYNAMITE! the trailer is better than the movie. BITCH are YOU fa REEEEEEL? The Human Tornadaaaahhhh!! dolemite is out of sight brothers and sisters Where can I see this movie?? Ha ha ha! Human Tornado!
Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil 	Sheiks the other day 6th, putangi g kaawn yan ang ppanget..haha a wicked world a wicked world ashokjatola 3 SUPER NIDE FILAM .

Cross of Iron 	Americans in German uniforms, acting like Americans. "And I will show you.. where the iron crosses grow."E P I C It's an old classic, shame Studiocanal are holding out for just a few more sales on it - releasing it here would have been great Thank you, captain obvious! That's very helpful! Seriously, this is an excellent movie.Watch it. Yes,Sir! penis Coburn is superb as the war jaded Steiner. STEINER IS A MYTH! A very good movie! Stupid trailer. Spoils the end of the whole movie.
It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown 	yeah Vince Guaraldi's last peanuts arbor day really well that's not a remembered Charlie brown special is it lol I hate to admit it, but I had to google to see what "Arbor Day" is. correctamundo! Actually, It's Between 1975 and 1976.
J.D.'s Revenge 	HE IS MY ENEMY adolphe ceasar did the narration FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER!!!! your cold......the coldest you have ever been in your life..... This is totally badass, jd's the mayne The sample has been found. :) "I'll see you on the cutting room floor!"
Jackson County Jail 	wtf woah tommy lee jones was a babe M Tommy Lee Motherfucking Jones!! Tommy Lee Jones! this looks awesome. No place for a lady! I went to that site. It looks like it was written by a tard.
James Dean 	ertha kitt. is never portrayed in any james dean ' story . he looks like idubz lol Someone pleeasseee tell me where i can watch this!! Legend. Who came here just to say James Franco The movie was really good. I do agree with someone of the commenters saying Franco didn't capture him enough, but honestly no one can ever truly imitate James Dean even with his flaws. I really identify with James Dean because I too had my father pulled away from me as a young child and now as an adult I'm still vying for his and my mother's approval. I am also very shy so it's difficult to express myself I always feel awkward and insecure. Funny enough I also dreamed of being an actress, but it never worked for me. Jimmy brought something so relatable and welcoming to his roles. He is and will always be greatly missed I think if you fused James Franco and Heath Ledger you would get James Dean I thought he was homosexuell ?! lol check this out.https://youtu.be/fKP9ZC__NII Honestly, they have the same first name, they look exactly alike, they BOTH were actors, if this isnt a damn good argument for reincarnation.. how fucking brilliant would it be for the universe to have him die early in his life to be remembered as a legend and then come back a few years later to star in his own goddamn biopic about himself and then make another set of INCREDIBLE tv series such as Freaks and Geaks and extremely entertaining movies such as Pineapple Express. If reincarnation is real and James Franco was James Dean it would be a masterpiece and every aspect of it would make so much sense. Who knows? He looks like Jimmy, but he needed to work a little more on getting the voice right. It's interesting because years ago before James Franco broke big, I watched this movie and I was quite convinced by his performance as James Dean. He was still a newcomer actor in those days, and I wasn't really familiar with him as a celebrity. I saw an anonymous young actor who did a good job of playing James Dean. But now, several years later, I look at this trailer and I don't see James Dean at all. I only see James Franco. Franco did an amazing job and was perfect to portray Dean.  James, it's Sept. 30th once again and each year that goes by, I still think about you and we all will forever miss you. Franco's portrayal of James Dean is ehhh...I think Dane Dehaan did a far better job in LIFE James Dean was absolute babe and so id James Franco you cant play james dean....IM JAMES DEAN Such a great movie James Franco Did amazing in his movie
Joe Panther 	Not exactly a family-friendly trailer...
Joshua 	she's also in the conjuring movies. the cut ass i would have put on that child eh.... only god knows.... best believe he would have snapped outta that shit that Lil Fk was a psychopathic  sociopathic pos devoid of feeling When will people ever realize that this is how kids can basically get away with everything?The really smart kids can become another real life Johan or Omen monster prodigy in the making.Kids are not always the not soo innocent ones when something just does not seem right like at all....If some kids ever made me feel like that then my guard is instantly going way the fuck up! 1:58 yeah, that'll provoke any parent doing that. If you can tolerate listening to a baby crying thru the whole dam movie this is for you. I'm a parent of 2 kids but DAM that crying got quite annoying. Joshua = Jesus (Yeshua is an alternate spelling).  Here "Joshua" (Jesus) is portrayed as a demonic psychopath.  Chalk up one more for the Jews.  A scene at 07:04 in the movie has the mother's line, "Couldn't he play 'Jesus Is My Savior?' on the piano"  Response: "No, he's not gonna be playing that". My cousin was the baby of that film This is like 5th or 6th movie with Vera Farmiga is playing the mother of evil child This is just like orphan. love this movie! this movie is missing something. Well I think he is sick as .... Fuck omgg people,listen to me!buy more condoms!all of you! :D I hated the part about the grandma then he acts all innocent! Like bruh really?! JOSHUA THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLE. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ENDING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bloody creepy amazing movie!! Good Movie.

Kenny & Company 	I've been a huge coscarelli Baldwin bannister fan since I was a boooooyyyy. This and Jim the worlds greatest need to be re released in a two pack dvd so I can complete my coscarelli journey. Can't find them reasonable anywhere!!!! I'm dying to see Kenny. I haven't seen this classic yet, but will shoirtly. The Halloween part looks hella nostalgic. That's one of the best scenes in the movie. When the boys enter the garage turned into a haunted house.  It's also the scene that inspired Phantasm. Coscerelli loved it when the audience jumped at the scene of the guy jumping out that he decided his next film had to be a horror film. It was a nightmare that gave him the idea of the sphere. 60s and 70s It's not sold in stores anymore. It's an out of print dvd. Ebay doesn't even have it. If you try Amazon you'll have to fork over a lot of cash. the lowest you can find it for is $69.99. The highest is $389.45.   Actually a lot of stores didn't carry it when it came out. I had to order it from Amazon when it was $9.99.  I've never seen this movie before, where can i find it on DVD? @ElCajoia That's what I've been telling all my friends. I was 10 living in SoCal when this was released. That was my life. This film is so much more now than it could ever be back then. A real treasure.  I was in 7th grade when I seen this, of all films out there, if you grew up in SoCal in this time period, it is exactly what it was like.   One of the best looks at the 70s EVER.
Keoma Ja 	ik ben vernoemd  naar deze film  Franco Nero would rip chuk Norris head of Whoa a Western with Jesus!! A forgotten masterpiece. @SomethingDangerous you are faggot Masterpiece. this movie sucks Great movie.
The Killer Inside Me 	One of the best portrait of psychopath of all time. Such a good film. thumbs up if you ended up here by searching simon baker movies What did Simon Baker in this movie? HE will always be the mentalist for me @HerrenbachStyle She didn't say iloveyou..She didnt even say a word.... @CrazyLittleEm Fear not! Simon Baker will have another movie role. It's Margin Call - about the 08 fi cial crisis. By the looks of the trailer, he's sort of the crafty antagonist (like Red John!) and might have a bigger role! Can't wait for it to come out! movie was entire shite. half of the movie is a softcore porn. lazy story and even lazier and more untalented  actors. @CrazyLittleEm When I saw this trailer that has Simon Baker in it, I was very excited (finally getting more serious film roles!). And from this trailer, it seems like he's playing a role that's similar to Patrick Jane (my favorite tv man!) so I had pleasant expectations from this noir film. Sadly, after watching the film, Simon Baker plays quite a limited role from the main story....and the brutality of the movie was overdone, the book was a lot better! @alekoep  a Texan accent Thumps up if you only watched this for Simon Baker? Jim Thompson's novel is chilling. omg this film is a waste of of your time, the story is too skin but the director wrote it long with that crappy psycho scenes, which in that girl gets ... you know... checked? i dont know which part of movie but he hits her 30 times in her face and says im sorry baby... i love you *continue hitting* and after 40 hits. the girl says: ''i love you'' i was like: OO WHAT THE HECK??? really its not worth it!! see the original w/ Stacy Keach & Susan Tyrrell - directed by Burt Kennedy Crap movie.
Do not waste your time 	Fuck, worst cgi explosion I've ever seen but meh, movie looks good. can please anybody tell me where to get english subtitle for this movie @9CRoC4   it is currently playing at the Fantasy Filmfest in Germany, but no release date yet does somebody know , when it's going to be in the german cinemas
The Killing of a Chinese Bookie 	rest in peace Ben! Cosmo takes care of business !!! Sasha Grey like it. trailer sucks (they didnt know how to make trailers in the 70s) but really good movie In LOVING MEMORY OF BEN GAZZARA (1930-2012) maybe it`s not the most influential films of cassavetes...but it isextraordinarily ,  because it is showing  all the shining talents of  his friend  mr.  ben gazarra   , as a main actor  ,  in  a most significant  way . Been playing this trailer over and over just for the bits of music at the start and end. A masterpiece with a brilliant performance from Ben Gazzara. Also features a character called 'Mr Sophistication' - once seen, never forgotten! One of the ALL TIME greats, RIP Ben. Ben - you were one the greats. RIP Ben, shit now the world really does suck for now on boooooooookie!!! the original release is borderline unbearable and the director's cut is awesome! i,m just interested because michael imperioli mention and recommend this movie  I just watched the Criterion release and could not for some reason take my eyes away from this film. Thanks for posting.Hows the movie?

The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane 	This trailer (that I remember from when it was new in the summer of 1977 !) made you think this was a "horror" movie. It's not. It's a "psychological drama / light - thriller via an After School Special". This movie has a huge cult following. One of the best and of my favorite movies ah, I remember this movie. no idea where to find it so what happen did the boy die ? incredible Watched this interesting movie on Epix Drive-In the other night! Honestly, Martin Sheen's character was the only thing I did care for until...he got his in the end! You don't slap someone else's child. She should die for that alone  I think she took it in the ass..That was the secret.. I love this movie!! I can't get enough of it. :)Sadly, i can't seems to watch it anywhere for free online... Excellent movie but not the horror movie the trailer suggests.
Logan's Run 	0:30 Jackson Beck's voice. He did a lot of commercials around this time along with Norman Rose, both who were regular cast members on CBS Radio Mystery Theater. He sounds like one of his cartoon characters here. New world order new world order New world order Greatest film ever made until 2001. Hah! Even 70s movie trailers told you the whole flipping plot. family guy brought me here they tell you the story in this trailer The trailer essentially gave away the plot of the entire film. Was that normal for movie trailers back then? i love this movie. have it in my vcr and yes i still have vcr and 36 years old allmost sounds a bit like brave new world, obviously not the same The 23rd century fashion looks straight out of a 70s sci fi catalog! It would be great that at 40 everybody could die in the way the movie shows, flying and exploding to disappeared. I probably already would be death. No old age, no diseases, only pleasures. knows anybody when the movie will out at 4k What annoys me is seeing this movie criticised whilst movies with sadistic endings are thought of more highly. Be it because it is science-fiction or for any other reason, if one wants to go into 'Logan's Run' with high expectations and come out the other end dissing it, one can. Alternatively, one can go in, get into the spirit of it and come out satisfied. where the nigger at where the nigger at were the nigger at Didn't read many replies but Logan's Run (at the time) was amazing. Michael York and Pete Ustinov!
Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby 	YASSSS Baby!! Well done vid. Bravo. Hello good day. Where did you buy this? Please say. I'm looking for sometimes. Thankyou

Man Friday 	masterpiece, respect! Kathy o'neill, what about how they mis treated and still mis treat human beings powerful movie..... best movie I ever seen on cable tv this is a movie that killed ! either way ! just like white people change the rules when your loser  Water song: "... Singing, singing in the water.... The water is a woman... The water is a woman,... First you put you body in... Then you pull it out again... Then you plunge it a little deeper... The water is a woman!!!"  I laughed SO hard when he sang that!!! Great Movie! Definitely in my Top 10!!! LMBO! I LOVED THIS PART!!! I just wish you showed the water song! "... It is saying: Hey that hurt! What you think you doing to me?!!!..." So funny. I appreciated the fact that this movie shed some light on the way Crusoe made "tried" to make Friday his slave under his belief that any civilization different than what he was used to we're to be considered "barbarians".  At felt that he was above them and that they needed his guidance. But as the movie continues, it is Crusoe who learns... anyone know the version of the movie where Crusoe makes friday his slave, the old politically incorrect version?  good movie They just showed this whole movie earlier today on "ShowTime".The last time I could remember seeing this movie was on regular network tv over 25 years ago during the mid 1980's when I was still a kid(that's funny how beautiful "Friday" runs.I remember laughing my ass off when I saw that part when I was a kid). The water song was priceless this show how crazy white people are in life and how they work as people even today I'm searching subtitles for this movie, but all I could find was GREEK and ROMENIAN. If somebody knows where to find it in ENGLISH or PORTUGUESE  please let me know.
The Man Who Fell to Earth 	this fucking trailer is oozing, practically excreting the seventies omg...so much stanley kubrick. written all over the movie.. Everyone is so starstruck by Bowie, (I can understand), or so awed by the weirdness of this movie trailer, (I feel ya there, too), that no one noticed the vid description is in Latin. Not Spanish, or anything like that. Latin. There's a story there, somewhere. I think it has something to do with soccer, lions, and porch therapy. God does this suck suck suck. Almost unwatchable. Screw u guys who spoil da movie guys whats the name of the song 8 seconds in the man who fell to heathen best david bowie movie... the movie is horrible but Bowie is awesome! the woman who was with him in this movie has the worst hairstyles ever... We all agree that this trailer is really bad, but, can't you see because of that, what have happened to film industry throughout the years? The clickbait thing has taken over cinemas just like it did over Youtube a while ago. And because of that, we take it as natural if the movie with good trailer comes out to be total trash. We really concentrate on the overlook, totally ignoring the core these days. This movie has such a sad ending it just makes me feel empty. I thought the plot would turn around but it just gets worse and then ends MARY LOU HELP ME The book is really good. A touching reflection on loneliness and what it means to be human. Compared to the book this film looks awful. This looks soooo badddd.... so he is like a 'starman' As a 70s time capsule TMWFTE is worth a watch, but otherwise this film has more than a few major flaws. For openers it deviated from the book    in many ways, is sequenced poorly and appears to have been used as a vehicle for the director/studio's agenda for reinforcing society's changing sexual mores. Worst of all the film just plain drags, especially during in the final half. Bad acting, plot holes, disjointed dialogue, the list goes on. And Bowie admitted to being high the whole time. It shows. Never understood how he fell from the skies, or why.  I mean what was he doing up there in the first place?
The Man in the Iron Mask 	The only Musketeers movie l can watch, because the others are shit! still my favorite in 2017.. btw what's the name of the soundtrack?not the one from braveheart. What is the name of the movie guess i won't have to watch the movie now, old trailers legit reveal all the big plot twists and basicly everything that happens.. like, why show that the men fire at the end there, why show that they make it to the river during the escape.. so stupid trailer One of the best films ever.. do you agree? sanji hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh He won a GRAMMY !! I love this movie it was a great story. I've been watching it since I was 9. A brilliant film, with a good trailer but I feel it reveals too much of the film. Plus the music at the end is clearly from Braveheart and not Man in the Iron Mask. :) What's the name of the music? leonardodiCaprioilikeitverymuchVeryniceguyformeCutebeautifulmanHandsomeguyamazingmoviesall I'm surprised no one here talking about the award he won yet lol yoo I had the biggest crush on Leo when I was 4 E foarte frumos filmul!Nu am cuvinte!! What is the music played from 0:00-0:30 #1and What is the music played from 0:50-1:11 #2 Un film exceptional de capa si spada care si-a meritat pe deplin toate premiile si distinctiile acordate inca din momentul lansarii si pana in prezent. In ceea ce ma priveste, acord acestui film calificatibul de " favorit ' si nota maxima. I love the music from Braveheart!! Thanks for sharing this trailer. By the way, in your description, you mention Leonardo DiCaprio twice and fail to mention Gabriel Byrne, who played d'Artag !
Marathon Man 	wtf 0:12 "TO BE OR NOT TO BE.....SAFE?"
Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary 	Thanks! I'm going to see this bloody horror movie! i have this movie on vhs
Massacre at Central High 	Synapse is putting this out on Blu-Ray in 2016.  that has to be the greatest kill in horror movie history, a bomb in a locker that is so wicked! @Rockets96KM Thanks for letting me know! This is awesome news. :D Did you post it? I want to see this!
A Matter of Time 	Ya can fucking laugh sarky but we both no it's just a matter of time before A&B get there hands on the idea of intergrading pipes into the electronic scene!!! "A broken heart consumes Nathan with bitterness blinding him from the true love of his life and stifling all his dreams. Sometimes finding love and happiness is as simple as opening up your heart."
The Missouri Breaks 	Too bad the trailer doesnt show Evil looking Jack Palance with fur coat, & his evil cowboy henchmen dealing with Brando and Nicholson. Marlon Brando, along with Al Pacino, the best actor of the world, no doubt about that.He was at his best during the 70's. A clever man, with millions of dollars, a lot of different women's in his arms...THE WILD ONE, THE MASTER, THE MAN!!! If all the trailers were like this back then I would never watch anything. The movie was 10x better than the trailer.Feh!(no reflection on you for posting it - thanks) Brando is delightfully psychotic and hillarious in this movie. Unfortunately when he's not on the screen it just seems dreadfully boring. And this is coming from a huge Nicholson fan.  indeed, this trailer sucks This is one of the worst trailers for a good movie that I have ever seen.  I totally agree. Great movie, horrible trailer.  Somehow Missouri Breaks one of the few westerns I ever got completely caught up in, if that means anything. this trailer made me not watch the movie Brando at his best "Lee Clayton" Great performances from Brando and Nicolson. indian pipel jaooooooooooo uay kil @UFOSPACE1999 I gotta disagree with you. I feel that this is the most underrated, if not the greatest Western ever made, HANDS DOWN. The Man with No Name series is highly overrated, as are most Spaghetti Westerns, (seeing as the dialogue and character development are sorry), John Ford is cool, but too Puritan, Tombstone is great, but still doesn't quite match up with this. It's unique and has everything you'd want. And Brando should be allowed to do his own thing, he's a genius. @StephenTatumActing what doth though mean Stephen?  Inquiring minds wanna know.
Mother, Jugs & Speed 	On m way to the hospital (in an ambulance) last week I found out the crew had seen and liked Mother Jugs and Speed God Bless America, God Save The Republic. Why is Cosby's character called Mother? during filming Bill Cosby took Margie Shapiro to the Playboy mansion then drugged and raped her. He did it in the guest house in the back so nobody would see it Mother Jugs and Speed.  Negro, tits and white guy! the beginning of cosbys rape career watch it! now about that tab. here kitty kitty.  #killbillyclub Saw this at The Loews State Theatre on 48th & 7th Ave NYC back in the day....GOOD MEMORIES... @narutofightindreamer - You are correct, the outlandish behavior in this film loosely mirrors how EMS once was. I started my EMT & later Paramedic career in Alameda County, specifically the Oakland area. I had the honor and privilege of meeting several "EMS dinosaurs". I listened intently to every word as they told me just how wild, crazy and eccentric some of the old guard in EMS were. Great history behind it all! The video release was 1988.  Key Video was closed in 1990 and CBS/FOX Video closed in 1998. are you unaware of all this let me guide you the excellent platform search panXCash 3 jello pudding pops are jealous how about showing the intro to the movie, with the ambulance being chased by the cop's  cars around the 20th century fox logo!  they have it very cheap on Amazon brand new for $4.99 It's a video trailer and not the actual theatrical  I saw this movie with my parents when it came out. It was hilarous! Cosby is funny!
Moving Violation 	awesome movie! very underrated but gets better with each time :) but what happenned to John Murray? did he quit acting, got into drugs or what? i recently saw his picture and he looks destroyed, doesn't even resemble that young guy with so much energy and so many laughs! Bill Murray's baby bro  - he did a god job.  This movie was funny  AF  XD omfg jenifer tilly -_- I really wish they would re-release it. this moving is super funny LOL HOW COME I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THIS MOVIE????????? XD Esta peli a mi me encanta. Las de Back to the future las dan todos los fines de semana, y esta no se les ocurre buscarla en la bodega ni por casualidad. classic @Sallie - John is a brother. Isn't that Bill Murray's son, or Brian-Doyle Murphy's son. you can stream it online This film was cute, had it's moments, but can't say it was ALL funny! Jennifer Tilly is always a hot one though! Awesome! Brings me back! : ) I enjoy this movie a lot...  the funniest movie ever made omg!! the voice at the end sounded like Duke Nukem This was a funny film. Laugh my ass off   @1975Spanky there's a bunch of scenes in this trailer that were never in the actual film :D saw this in 1985
Mustang Country 	Similar sounding to the Thom Pace song for Grizzly Adams I give it 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars this was the best movie i ever seen! 5 star vid right here!

Nashville Girl 	On blu ray now from Scorpion Releasing, great movie. coal miner's daughter?
Network 	watching this  from Romania in 10/Feb/2017 <-- Ha guess the ending was Ironic, Television stayed the same - in control of us.Hey what is a plot in a movie, about how movies control people called again? H hhhhyyy hhyyyypp ... I can't remember from all the movies I saw. 40 years later, this film is still powerful, outrageous, and even more relevant than when it was first released! Actually, the movie wasn't intended to be a satire. Paddy Chayefsky simply wrote what he experienced (working at ABC network) and where he felt television was headed. Network was brought to us by the Transamerica company And that's why people like us are flocking to Donald J. Trump! Cuz we mad as hell, and we are not gonna take this any more!!! Has his movie been released to Blu ray love to have it and see again Christine Chubbuck brought me here Alex jowski send me here Perturbator! Michael angelakos brought me here rage against the machine ghost of tom joad anyone? :D better call saul!!!!!!!! Ahh, Shaun Micallef also has a show called Mad as Hell, here i was thinking the title and content is unique, no, TV lies again.. Film is a triumph. Stands up well almost at 40. Contains some stark warnings about media and tv domi ce and dumbing down of the populace. Amazingly funny at parts. For Peter Finch, an Australian like myself, it was a role to end a career on: a man in extremis. Im mad as hell I'm not gonna take it any.. oh game of thrones is on. RIP Finch RIP Lumet RIP Holden This is a bit too long. Spoils quite darn much I bet >.> "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"
The New Daughters of Joshua Cabe 	Great movie thanks Buddy Ebsen and Jack Elam.....what a pair. GREAT movie. Very cute I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS WHEN I WAS A KID. LOVED IT THEN AND LOVED IT NOW Thank you, very nice movie. a fun movie, light hearted and serious at the same time Decent movie considering how long ago 1972 was. Shame this didn't sell as a series we need more movies like this.
Nickelodeon 	he is not a v POLLY Oh my gosh she plays polly on Riverdale what's the songs name? ITS COOL PREETY MUCH BUT HE LIED!!!!!!!!! umm twilight much?? Isn't that jazz from every witch way and this is a copycater from twighlight ok i looked up  these kids age apparently she was 15 at the time this film was made and he was 19 isint it illegal for them to have sexual contact??? This is twilight But then in a funny style This is literally a twilight parody Does anyone know the song played in the prom part ( the name basically) in the movie. He's is not a vamp the only reason he sparkles in the sunlight because he sprinkled glitter on himself Rahart is hottttttttttttt<3 Still better love story than twilight... What if Nick created Liar Liar Vampire 2 and made it about: Davis becomes an actual vampire, and he tries to hide it from the school, the only person that's aloud to know is Vee :)))) Just an idea!
Nightmare in Badham County 	That was Tina louise that raised the strap in the last two minutes, and Della Reese who stood up to her. I guess the viewer can draw his or her own conclusion as to whether or not TL died, but she was rendered unconscious, at any rate. Robert Reed's voice sounded a lot like Andy Griffith's. I thought Deborah Raffin's friend had died. I watched this movie before, but forgot a lot of the details. It showed Chuck Connors raising, cocking, and aiming his rifle, but the way I (erroneously) remembered it, the bullet hit her. I turns out he did kill her, but the audience didn't see it. it's kind of sad they can't make movies like this no more how awesome with this s*** be in HD Jesse lee Peterson you're a lying motherfucker. Racism always existed. I still remember when it still existed in the 70s, and it still exist now. You ignorant uneducated coon. I remember watching the uncut version of this movie back on cable television & several years earlier I remember watching the edited version back on Philadelphia's WGBS57' around the time when the network used to show night time moves & somewhere during the movie I remember the scene when the Superintendent ( Robert Reed ) sent for this teenager to pleasure him by the swimming pool but to her she wasn't comfortable plus she's just a kid when this happened to her in which she was found dead later on then buried , but my mother told me the movie was based on the actual events but only the names & the locations were changed to protect those who's still living today . How was this a made for TV movie? 32:00 was not long enough 16:05, 31:40, 1:18:10  Nice! Joe Bob Briggs turned us on to this. ive been looking for this movie for a long time Ginger got touched by an Angel. Out of Print.  SO glad to find this!  Thank you!!!!!!!!!
Norman... Is That You? 	Boring movie.
Northville Cemetery Massacre 	0:35 truer words have never been spoken Hard to believe after a short time this director went on to make Harry and the Hendersons. Amazing flick
Obsession Interracial, Fatal Attraction 	25 years later Well they say once you go black, you never go back so... People these days: "This trailer basically showed the entire movie". Um nigga wtf LMFAO like a fit blonde would fight for him please it's always the fat white hoes that thirsty ...Fatal Attraction. who came here or saw this movie because of its advertisement on America's Next Top Model Cycle 12? LOL I know I did liked idris elba more when he was in pacific rim he could give her the whote woman a hardcore anal lets see if she keep chasin the black man hell no..come on that is idris elbause the talent for better good she wanted to spit shine his black turd lol Who's watching this in 2017? cool..the guy from the Takers..Love him Is this worth watching? Luther is always getting blackmailed yessss bey tear that bitch up i love this movie i like the pairing of idris and  Ali Larter  its hot and sexy black and white combination
Ode to Billy Joe 	Another great movie from Max Baer Jr! i was so in love with robbie benson in 1976-- his face pics where all over my bedroom wall-- still think he gorgeous Exactly, the song didn't tell us this version. In Hollywood everything is gay. i was 18 when i first seen this-- im almost 59 now-- is there any way to slow down time??, i seen it on the big screen in halifax nova scotia with my boyfriend,, he is dead now.. this movie will always be part of my youth me too
The Omen 	I hated the main guy the entire movie for switching and lying about his adopted son as his own genuine.I think The Exorcist 1973 is the scariest/best movie of all-time. The spear part at the end of this trailer reminds me of that part on the first Austin Powers where the guy got ran over, simply because he time to move outta the way but didn't. Such a great movie. The Omen has to be one of the scariest movies ever made. This is on Netflix rn... I had to look at the trailer before I watch it.. i watched this movie when i was 7 !!!!!! The pope is his name 'vicar of Christ' in place of Christ in Latin. Francis Bivera theory to discredit the prophets I loved this I thought this film would be sort of warm-full like Gone with the Wind, not this creepy thing nice garry I never want to watch this movie because im christian and the son is a antichrist Pewdz Lucius brought me here Don't worry for the Doctor, he regenerates! :D In this movie, at the hospital, when Lee Remick noticed that Mrs. Baylock entered her room, she could have screamed for help before being thrown out of that window. Lee should have made some "NOISE"! "Woe to you, Oh Earth and Sea, for the Devil sends thebeastwith wrath, because he knows the time is short...Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of thebeastfor it is a human number, its number is Six hundred andsixty six." 666  :-) The story of the rise of Donald Trump? Lol boringgggg!!!!! Love, P The Scariest MOVIE EVER!!!! The Ultimate horror movie! A MASTERPIECE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END!!!Jerry Goldsmith so deserved the OSCAR for the SCARY score which was also A MASTERPIECE like this amazing movie.10 out of 10! Go Omen!
Dragonfly 	shit my fav movie Best movie there is, I cry everytime I see it
Operation 	Wish someone would make a factual, classy movie about the Korean war.  Maybe Eastwood could make one about the real Heartbreak Ridge! Watched this ,thought it was rubbish a story of the war which was fucking illegal! if you want something get done... ask liam neeson Ok, who wants a Korean War Battlefield game right now? Oh what is that? I already made it for you? BAM!http://www.moddb.com/mods/battlefield-korea oh great a LEADING ACTOR who doesn't believe in the right to bear arms in YET ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT USING GUNS TO WINBOYCOTTING.liam neeson needs his throat slit, preferably by a serial killer. I want to to protect my mother...Liam smiles about last night"thinking inside and as they show his mom, i already did her last night... Kill the commie - kill-kill-kill! Though the story is based from the true one, the actions are typical Korean drama, unrealistic to the very bits Operation discount CGI Shittiest Korean movie i have ever watched. The resistance kept dying and coming back, while the U.S did all the talking, and came in at the end to play 'POLICE'. all this war and spy movies coming this last years .....i wonder if korea has ever lived in peace....and now they are even attacked by zombies OMG this CGI Well they Hollywooded that all to hell and back. Liam is on yet another ship The South Koreans really know how to make a good war movie. It's a heartfelt salute to their war heroes. Very well done. I hope to see more of Jung-jae Lee. great story piss poor movie just watched it oh dear only my opinion Ahhh yes, I too remember Douglas MacArthur having a strong Irish accent. this was the biggest piece of shit of a movie I have seen in the last 10 years I think...God damn it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Asian Rambo
The Outlaw Josey Wales 	This films inspired me to make a film someday a western film Clint Eastwood epitomises the American western. This one is his masterpiece. This trailer is more dramatic than the movie itself, especially with the music lol, gives it a dark feeling despite the fact the movie has a lot of light hearted jokey scenes. still an marvelous movie nonetheless "You gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?" Damn Straight - I'll do both. Spit* Hows it with stains? 01:13- You're wanted Wales..- You a bounty hunter?- A man's gotta do something for a livin these days..- Dyin ain't much of a livin boa...One of the best movie lines ever.. I have this poster in my room just an outstanding movie just don't get these types of movies anymore unfortunately One of the best western movies of my childhood. THIS, and Jeremiah Johnson, haha. Quite possibly one of the best westerns ever! The Southern Loss is not forgotten .... download right away :s
People of the Wind 	Cyrus the Great -Darius the Great, Mohammed Mossadeq -Karim Khan Zand.and many more they are also Bakhtiari about : Bakhtiari peopleElam was an long-lasting ancient civilization just to the east of Mesopotamia, in what is now southwest Iran. Elam was centered in the far west and southwest of what is now modern-day Iran, stretching from the lowlands of what is now Khuzestan (Bakhtiari people ) This people are the bakhtyari trib and from west and South west from the iran .There are older people in the my country and there have very gently and pretty in there lives.I am a bakhtyari man ...Wow ...I am feeling a king man !!!!Yes I am a bakhtyari...The bakhtyarian people are very love kabab and  freedom and democracy !!!!! My favorite documentary of all time. Actually there was another doc that followed these people on the same trek 2 generations previously! Titled "Grass" directed by the director of the original King Kong...order dvd from Amazon--lost history most people will NEVER see or know about. POW follows the grandchildren of Grass. The people are iranian mountain tribe-not Afghans. My favorite movie by far! I am so happy I found a DVD of it at my library!!! I wish more people would see this beautiful film.While its not a documentary about the people of Afghanistan it certainly is fair representation of what the rural lives were like, at least  when they were unfettered by deadly politics, strife,  and war. Often the west tries to apply modern principles to peoples who live in a separate Universe, at dire consequences to both sides. Amazing book if you can find a copy
The Pink Panther Strikes Again 	Wish they could release a version of this film with all the deleted scenes in Very funny. Easily the FUNNIEST film in this series! But you need to see "A Shot In the Dark" and "Return of the Pink Panther" to fully understand this one... My school doing this for the school play... I really aught to know these characters and figure out what's best for me. I personally like being the crazy guy. Quite a few deleted scenes in this trailer. this film is the best. I hert my belly how much i laught.
The Pom Pom Girls 	Brilliant movie ! 11 years old and love this movie! I like the part when they steal the fire engine and hose down all the jocks on the playing field. I thought this was a horror movie. At the start they burn an effigy of a ball player but it just got goofier and goofier. They must of had a ball whilst filming this. That mud pit tug of war part would of been a blast too. See that pale chick in the classroom - she was ugly. One girl's ass was so white it looked albino. 'Some' of the girls looked better with clothes on. Nice trailer can't wait to see the movie, those five girls wearing hot, spicy bikini bathing suits in the beach cheerleading, Super sexy!! So BAD  it was GREAT!!!!! @grindhousejunky79 Gee, the first "American Pie" wasn't half-bad; but then I didn't see enough "teen" films from any era to compare. Another good one from this era was "The Chicken Chronicles", though it had a little less hijinx than Pom Pom Girls and tried to have a socially conscious background story (Vietnam). "Sally" from Pom Pom Girls (Lisa Reeves, if I remember correctly) was in Chicken Chronicles too, opposite Steve Guttenberg.       @57highland I agree about the whole remake issue, I've always despised remakes, they too often completely desecrate the integrity of the original. The only period when they did remakes right was the 80s. But yes, the heart of this film (the vibe of being young and care-free) would undoubtedly be lost in favour of a nonstop flow of bland and thoughtless t'n'a toilent humour, ala American Pie or Tomcats bleecccchh. @grindhousejunky79 Yes, this movie had just enough "moments" in it to be remembered and possibly revived. On the other hand, maybe it's better being obscure, because if it was better known, someone would do a "remake" that would be inferior in every way but which today's kids would rave about. (I saw this in the theater when it was current; wasn't one of those lucky ones who saw it at the drive-in with a "Sally" or a "Laurie"!)  Shout Factory should really release this film in a stand alone special edition dvd/bluray with tons of extras: commentary tracks, a documentary detailing its making, its massive success on the drive-in circuit, and it's blatant influence on films like Dazed And Confused. Right now it's unfortunately only available on several budget dvd sets  and double feature discs, and this film deserves better than that. A  cult classic that truly symbolizes both the  drive-in era at its peak and the care-free attitude of 70s youth, just having fun your own way, not worrying about the future, live like youre gonna be this young forever. You really get that vibe from this movie even today, despite the admitted ring of cheese thats gathered around it's edges over the decades. Great flick Its just a bit of a shame it's been mostly forgotten/unknown by todays audiences. I just bought Drive-in cult classics from amazon.com and this movie,Malibu Beach and Van Nuys Blvd. were also in the box set. It has been 35 years since I saw this at the drive in back in the 70s. It was nice to see the girls without the silicone implants they have today. The music back then was so much better than today's music. I've always wondered what the people in this movie look like today. Such an entertaining flick.  I also think it's a great timepiece into the 70s.  the clothes the cars the ahir...the females. "There is no way in hell that someone is gonna walk into the fire house and take a *sees car*..." My aunt is actually in this movie.  She's one of the main girls the funniest movie ever made, seen this on a dvd box set i got it from my library last year! My sister and I raved about this movie growing up. @tonetone71 -- Yeah, "The Big Doll House" from mid 70s. Sort of a soft-core porn about a women's prison. Pam Grier might have been in it, or someone who looked like her. @tonywallacess45 Yea,So Bad,It was Great!! Man this movie was weak
The Premonition 	I don't care about the movie. I care about the taurus that was destroyed. i have the same model and year, same package. I hate this movie. This ending is the most unreal bullshit ive ever seen like seriously. Sb tries to tell me that this truck just couldnt break normally? or just drive around it onto the right side...  nooo a normal person drives his truck left right left so the gas tank turns sideways and hits the car RIIIIGHT. this would make a great video game for ps4 so sad(( Sandra's Bollocks. She's a greener, and she's married to a guy who likes to kill birds, but he doesn't want het to know, so he hires the whole fucking town to fool her into thinking he died. But not, and stuff. Baa. Lmao I rented this movie at Hollywood video talk about a throwback OBSOLETE anyone knows any movies like this ??? The trouble w/double header is u only get 7 innings each so real only a 1/2 game more not an extra game+ u hve a 30 min gap to wait thru(ok 4 US living next door though). they lost the 1st game again. That is 4 games watched & 4 losses+ the 1st double header 2nd game we left early was also a loss. At least todays double game starts early, & Shannon doesn't hve to work tomorrow. They made base running error early, mental stuff, +they go behind early a lot,+ r pitching always seems inferior, starters wise. 5 vs 4 & walked to get force, but gave up 3 run shot. UN LINK PARA VERLA? 2 1/2 sized little brown birds, chased away a large blue gray striped blue jay wanna b. I was a sec slow on out take, not up uptake. If u <believe> the forecast the shower we just got was it, & rest of day onward is about 15%. On a Sunday no less, what would ppl say:).
The Quest 	I've watched this movie so many times. My childhood would not have been complete without JCVD and the three ninjas lol Considering this is a JCVD movie, I fully expected it to just be another cliched fighting movie where the protagonist is placed in a difficult situation requiring he fights his way to receive some reward from a dangerous, yet completely implausible, secretive fighting tournament.  Thank God I was wrong. Roger Moore should have won an oscar for this. the fact that they havent named this movie The Golden Dragon but choose to go with The Quest is beyond science He stole this or tried to from Frank Dux after they wrote it together.... Sad Jean Calud let Hollywood destroy him with drugs. such a awesome action film star!!! What does the phrase "watch out for your tail" mean in the movie? my favourite thing about 80s trailers is the need for the narrator explaining the premise Van damme did like 9 movie based on bloodsportnlol Jesus Christ Venereal Disease Great movie buenas noches, soy Diego de Argentina quisiera saber donde puedo ver THE QUEST porque no la encuentro en ninguna pagina completa. Solo encuentro propagandas. Espero respuesta. Gracias It's my favorite JCVD movie! And one of the best of martial arts movies of all time!!! @shadowman2192 Well said ! :-) This movie flopped but God knows why, it was freakin awesome!...The martial arts was amazing the choreography was excellent and Van Damn is a great director, any action fan should love it.Definitely my favorite Van Damn movie.
Reisen til julestjernen 	Ser fortsatt den fra 1976 hver Jul. Men dette er nok den beste remake jeg noengang set. Gleder meg Deanerys Targarien?? noen?? Jeg kan ikke tro de solgte rettighetene til disney!! D: D: D:  zeiner og heksa ja og fra asker!  bra film...men den orginale er den beste ;) Imponerende og vakker film, anbefales! Filmen ser veldig spenenes ut og Eilif ser bra ut . Norske filmer<3 Hva faen?
The Return of a Man Called Horse 	What is the music to 29 second? What is the music to 29 second? This movie was very nice and totally engrossing !
Revenge of the Cheerleaders 	A happier, wilder, wackier America... can President Trump bring this vibe back? ROBOT HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUSE! saw this movie back in college at the dollar theatre. Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.  Ever. Is this the movie where one of the cheerleaders or their friend fucks a midget surfer on the beach? Pause at 1:41 lol haha man i do love cult classics Can someone please put this film on here in full please many thanks xx At 3:04, that's David Hasselhoff. yuk yuk, Har Har. preg t chicks
The River Niger 	I remember watching this movie when I was to young to understand what was happening except for the savages burning crosses on Black peoples property, and the pedophilia bastard got done off now that's real family that has your back. The Black family stuck together back then now were moving backwards integration has us fu@ked up completely. Thanks so much for this post!!! ....And you better not...fuck up! Nice film. Also, I think the son played a role in the TV series "It's A Different World". Every year I watch this just to hear the powerful poem. It reminds me of Langston Hughes' The Negro Speaks of Rivers... But Jones could invest a reading of the alphabet with enough emotion to make us cry.                        I've known rivers:I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the     flow of human blood in human veins.My soul has grown deep like the rivers.I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln      went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy      bosom turn all golden in the sunset.I've known rivers:Ancient, dusky rivers.My soul has grown deep like the rivers.                                          Langston Hughes I had the privilege to have had Joe Walker as a professor and mentor. This work is truly an inspiration. U betta not fuk up Soundtrack for this movie is by the original artists of WAR, (Lowrider, Why Can't We Be Friends?, Cisco Kid, Slippin' Into Darkness, Spill The Wine, etc..) who are now called the Lowrider Band at facebook.com/LowriderBand. thank you I've been looking for this movie I'm sure it wasn't me because I didn't have a gun and didn't touch any girls.After I left some bad shit happened but I was miles away by then.I ran 5 miles an hour for about an hour and that got me clear of this. I was invited to this party and was there but left before the shooting started.Well, really I was just out on the front porch smoking a cigarette when all thoselapd cops arrived in their screeching police cars. I ducked for cover like a young boy would. I wasn't involved so the cops didn't need to talk with me.I just ran down the street like hell and got some bus a few miles away.Party turned sour so I left before it was over. This film crew serves notice to Whitey like me that they reallywant us on their side. Of course I can scream nigger at someone.I'm their nigger and I'm their white boy. I don't use any fake or real gunsbut I'm not scared to drive and/or walk around south central.Been around there for a long time and I got nerve. I'm watching this because War band suggested.Once I started to get a load of it I realize how great James EarlJones is and how real south central LA is. This movie is a fakeof real life but the reality is real. Maybe this, maybe that, maybewhite, maybe black. Like Rhett Butler said, frankly my darlingjust don't give a damn anymore. There some guns in this like9mm glocks and those are for real but the ones in the movie aren't loaded.Remember guns only kill if they have ammo. If I was in that sceneI'd've shot the bad dudes dead immediately. This is why the coolerspirits in south central can be trusted with mild firearms. THANK YOU!!!  This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated films of our time!  The performances, poetry, and dialogues are BRILLIANT!  Thanks again! love this movie This is one of my favorite movies great movie this movie is so interesting. An all time fave right here! This is one of those movies I could watch everyday it is one of my all time favorites.
Robin and Marian 	"I love you more than god" It's a shame that Robin didn't live long enough to rid the land of Prince John. He was a rotten son-of-a-gun and no better than Richard. More than likely, he would become an even worse king than Richard. But, I guess it was just Robin's time to go and besides that wickedness can never be extinguished or rid of. This is Audrey's last appreciable appearance before the forgettable Bloodline (1979) and They all laughed (1981), and the really unacceptable Love Among Thieves (1987) What is it about a movie with Sean Connery facing against Robert Shaw that I find so appealing...? a sad movie  I suppose so. In the 13th century, he seems to have been a generic outlaw or trickster character in folklore, without specific localisation, some would trace him to "Robin Goodfellow", i.e. Puck. In 1420, he was placed "in Inglewood and Barnsdale" (Lytil Jhon and Robyne Hude / Wayth-men ware commendyd gude / in Yngil-wode and Barnysdale) but from 1450 or so, the association with Sherwood and Nottingham was there. I base this on Wikipedia, which has a rather well-developed article on this. Yeah mabye, but he was supposed to come from Nottingham right..?? look, you seem to think Robin hood is an identifiable historical character. When in fact, as the trailer correctly states, he is 600 years of story-telling, and during these 600 years, he was always made into just what people wanted him to be at any given time. He was only made "a Saxon" resisting "the Normans" in the 19th century. Spielberg wanted Oliver Reed to play Quint in Jaws, but the actor said the project was "too sissy for him". James Bond, Red Grant and Eliza Doolittle in one movie?Count me in! the villian is Quint from Jaws and Red Grant from From Russia With Love Nah, the language had evolved by then to something sounding more like English. So he was speaking German then?  Ah yes, Robin Hood in Russian, German, Swedish, or Danish etc etc for a local audience is one thing...But not speaking English with a Russian or German accent. Well, I see your point, but what about Robin Hood speaking in Russian or German for example? :D the Sherif was played excellently. Really captured the weariness of a hastled bureaucrat fighting an outlaw is it me or this trailer is too long? Hard to imagine that the sherrif is Quint from Jaws.
Rocky ich sitze in der schule 	xD "ALL" the Rocky movies to me are a form of......... "BULLING & VIOLETS" & those are the parts i didn't like at all (shaking head at those parts of the movie)  -_-  -_-  -_-   -_- Awful trailer,but handy if you want to watch Rocky box set but didn't fancy watching all of part one haha I shed a tear from the trailer alone. This movie will go down in history Never goes off date This movie is shit JohnVexer!! Thank you Dude for posting this GEM!! Man, I love these old-school 70's clips. Wow, this must have been the original trailer seen in theaters before Rocky's initial release. So basic with no narration over the clips, but the clips were excellently chosen. For it's time it was well put together. he proposed in the zoo.... Love the 70's films! Rocky, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Star Wars, The Godfather, Halloween... a pretty awesome age!! 40 years old... hard to believe. 40 years of proving the strength of the underdog and inspiring millions to be the best of themselves. Happy anniversary Rocky! Happy birthday Rocky 40th !! FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!  40 years ago tomorrow! WOW! Can't believe it has already been that long! does anyone else like rocky 2 better than rocky 1? Apollo Creed vs The Italian Stallion...Sounds like a goddamn monster movie!!! Anybody that isn't cheering for Rocky is a sorry excuse for a human being. Leuk en spanend
The Savage Bees 	I remember this movie I seen this manny years age I remember this tv movie as a kid with the finale involving having to drive a bee covered car into the Superdome so they could drop the temperature to neutralize the bees. Cheesy
Scorchy 	I actually watched this movie during my teens in the 80s at an old cinema in India. And yes, the poster of Connie Stevens showing her legs thru the slit gown lured me right in. Have this on VHS and it needs to be seen again. I just hope the fast forward is working I was in the crowd scene during the chase scene in the Seattle fi cial district. And now you know this was decades ago "very good". I am 62 and some how I missed this movie. I've never even heard of it until today when I stumbled across it on the internet looking for something else. Maybe I'll try to find it and watch it just for kicks. Wow, how did this get passed up for an Oscar? I think we can all agree that this is a terrible movie worth watching only to see Connie Stevens in her prime nude.  this movie is hilarious but I have to say there is a car chase in it that extremely impresive1 Just one word, "Damn!". I was 25 when this show came out and all I can say is she should have been wearing spandex ! she still ROCKS my boat. Connie did, and still does have the most fantastic body, and face. I went to see this movie in college, just to see her naked.
Sebastiane 	All of you hating bitches in the comment section. lol. Looks Stupid AF i wanna see this movie i wonder when is gonna be available he's so cute!! I love :50-:51 OMG ANYONE ELSE HEAR HIS VOICE CRACK MULTIPLE TIMES Michael ? : D Wow he really loves playing psycho-killers after all... I love it! Dee Wallace in another movie with Daeg lol... Is this the movie that never went anywhere?  The only two things I've seen him in are "Halloween" & "Hancock," & I've been looking forward to seeing him in something more. Ok.... Deag went from badass little kid, to gay french kid, to badass mother fucking teenage whip-yo-ass killer..... why was I not aware of this...masterpiece?! I really wana see this even tho it was cancelled :( By the way the movie was cancled. I would tell you his birthday but my mum told me not to. Dunno why He is kind but anoying Guys no need to get excited he already got a girlfriend he my cuz and trust me he is not as cute as he looks TRUST ME daeg is a badass dude he has braces, never knew that hes hair in this movie is long but now hes hair is short wow Oh my.. Daeg is so hot! I would like to see this movie, and more interviews. <3 omg daeg please dont be in sweet boy movies, your sexy in killing ones ;)
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution 	Great movie but I thought Nicholas Meyers directed the film, not Herbert Ross.
Shadow of the Hawk 	good old Chief Dan George! Weird movie!
Shark Kill 	I have that watch in lilac, yay, not really. The Shallows is the most thrilling movie i ever seen in a long time, one of the best!i feel every bit of pain of the girl in da movie brah i don't have the DVD version..... WAAAAAAAAH So, maybe I missed it or something, but what was the name of the secret island/beach? This trailer is like the entire movie...without any more shazams...But the flaming shark tho...And don't forget about the seagull!!! 80 minute commercial for Blake Lively's body. spotted! serena van der woodsen fratanising with the enemy! better watch out who you swim with s you may get dragged under.xoxo gossip girl Best Movie EVER! The movie was alright, I just cringed with the cheesy skype/phone calls, the dialogues were awful and the music when the three surfers were having fun at the beginning was really bad too. Nope nope. The shark is a pervert ok! So what's the name of the beach? loved the movie as good as jaws Thsi girls acting is so bad I'm actually rooting for the shark how did nobody on the beach see her and try to pick her up Steven Seagull
Sherlock Holmes in New York 	No scenes of them on either the boat train or the  crossing itself.  Not necessary to  the plot I suppose. I would think that his periodic addiction to a 7% solution  of injected (whatever that might equal in snorting of the powdered version)  of cocaine, a very definite "chink in Holmes armor" Thanks for  putting this movie on youtube. Why Watson have be so dumb? Huston's Moriarty makes this for me.
Silent Movie 	Anyone else pissed that La La Land won best film of 2016 and not this? Can't believe this was nominated for almost no Oscars. I haven't seen it (so I can't judge) but usually Scorsese films get a huge amount of buzz and this one just came and passed by with hardly a word from the academy. stupid movie went and watch this movie without knowing what it was or who in it...first scene I was like, ok...it's the guy from taken, so it's a movie about Japan. next scenes,  stfu it's kylo ren and spiderman!! great movie! It is Jesuitical teaching about confession and full Jesuitical moral theology.  If anyone wants to know about Jesuit moral theology, read Catholic Blaise Pascal's book, Provincial Letters.    It is evil, evil, evil, and had nothing to do with Christianity. It is the most perniciously evil movie I have ever seen, and it is full Jesuitical teaching.  They are EVIL. this reminds me of a jesuit history what a long ass movie IT'S AN HONOUR ...THAT MARTIN HAS CHOSEN ANDREW this is Scorsese's worst movie. this movie was a classic i watched the movie just now, i have to say it shows how stupid religion really is. pretty similar to a virus that likes to spread and screw everything else. when they came to Japan and started saying that their god is best thats where you screw up. you dont come to other countries and say whatever you heard from someone else. what if you are following a complely made up story about a man named Jesus? seriously have you never thought about that. all i know is that all wars have been in the name of religion. those wars that that have been recently started is because a religion in power in the United states and UK have a hate on the muslim people. so its all in the name of religion. stupidity at best. Magnificent film when will the movie come out? stupid jesuits, now they are brainwashing the public with their lies, these corpses of hell are responsible for the liberal agenda, they are the ones fighting against president Trump! Nice story. from spiderman to hero of ww2 now he's a what? This makes me want to be a Catholic Priest.
Sky Riders 	Cheesy film
The Slipper and the Rose 	So I just watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again & it made me think that FOX should another musical television film base on The Slipper & The Rose either next year or sometime in the near future. & who do you think should star in it? Please let me know, thank you! Please watch my piano arrangement of Secret Kingdom And Sharaz Jek as the Beaver. I love this movie.
A Small Town in Texas 	I think your channel is becoming in my top ten of all time
Led Zeppelin Naglfar?	Is that what it meant by western shore? I thought it was docked on the eastern shore but ok.xD I like this song..make me feel good..yearghhh Dunn dunn da dadada dun dun dadada what is the name of this song OH YEAH Now a movie for the music! KNICE Finally I know who's sing this song let the kids know about music. Perfect song for the perfect movie aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa I've waited for Marvel to use this song in one of their trailers since way back, when the first Thor movie got released. And now they did it, AT LAST. This song and those movies always were meant for each other, for very obvious reasons. i knew this trailer would work as a music video without sound effects or dialog Awesome The views on this will skyrocket. led in Thor Muito fodaaaa
Sparkle 	I love this movie Is this about en vogue ? ALR/apes/uglyasswahoe/liar/beytch/ectYay Movie soo sweet movie so good Do anybody know were I can view the part when she song THAT beautiful song for her sister, she called it ONE WIG?? THANKS Cello green has an amazing voice, that's all The fatGuy can't Stay downCan't amgen Men fighting Over sisterBe aGirl likeThat........Lmao ofa atu  sister wow an exact copy of Dream girls This is good but I like Dream Girls more :) Good The other two were hotter... don't make a fucking movie trailer a racial issue. Goddamn. you do realize that the "sidechick" woman was the most headstrong of the sisters and achieved a near full ride scholarship to medical school. Stop feeding into the hype and just be confident in yourself and your skin no matter what society tries to say sheesh I loved it Honestly, the way you're 'noticing' this is racist itself. They're black, there's no need to define them as light skin and dark skin. it's a shame that Mike Epps. watching this on tv now ima be real and say this movie wasn't better then the original. Alicia Keys shoulda played "Sister" love the songs It's "cause they're hot!!!
Squirm 	i didnt take shower for years after watching this !!! Anyone seen the MST3K episode of this? OK i think thats the ground why i am afraid of Worms ><' (i saw that movie when i was 4)sorry for bad englisch ^^" Directed by guiermo del toro and Michael bay this is so brutal death metal cool they blurayed this film only seen a grainy vhs of it Other than when is was seen on mst3k, I've only seen this once on tv, back in the early 1980s when broadcast tv channels weren't really censored too much...especially independent stations. The only things I remembered were copious amounts of worms...which creep me out to this day....and the skinny, ginger girl's scrawny nude scene in the shower....creepier than the worms.
St. Ives 	Very funny movie must one to watch. I can't stop thinking of the scrub. :P This film is nothing special, but Anna Friel was really cute back then, Miranda Richardson played an interesting female character and Richard E. Grant was (as always) excelent. :) seems funny and good, hm thanx ;) I absolutely love this movie!!! Miranda is so amazing!! I do have to say that this is not the best trailer for it, though. It doesn't seem to give the movie justice. Then it gives away too much in the end. I did quite enjoy it, though! Thanks for uploading!
Stalk the Wild Child 	Almost a quarter of the scenes here aren't even in the movie. How does that work?? it's so funny :) Now I know it ---> that poppy is a wild child :D is this a disney movie? where can I download any movies Oh, I loved this movie. I used to watch it with my sister. Did anyone notice that the school is at the Croft manor? Song 0.10 What's the song called at the beginning?? i do not like this move Does anybody know the song in the background? THIS IS WHERE THAT POPPYS NAME CAME FROM So this is how poppy came up with her name IS THAT POPPY OMG Explains why I've always loved lacrosse! i love the movie any similiar movies like this or mean girls???? Should I watch this? This movie was so cringe daming pinapagawa sa GEPSYCH dahil dito pucha
A Star Is Born 	on of my favorite films be hard to live up to Streisand This movie fits Lady Gaga prefect...can't wait this is soo Gaga <3 Now we know why Bradley grew beard lady gaga and jared leto are good at it.. Barbra will play Lady Gaga's Mom!! cant wait!!!! Yass gagaga IN LIVING YAAAAS GAGA Oh my god! Lady gaga will be perfect for this!!!! She will win a Grammy!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gaga in the new film <3 Come through Gaga! loved everything about this movie when I saw it in 77....still do. Hilariously bad. Pretty much the worst choice as a venue for the Babs. It is the worst attempt of any rock and roll movie. July Andrews would have been better suited to sing rock.True Babs fans would eat any crap she serves though. Funny how Judy Garland, who played the leading lady in the 1954 version of this movie, and Barbra Streisand actually performed a duet years ago where they did a polyphony of Judy's song Get Happy and Barbra's song Happy Days Are Here Again. Barbra adored Judy so much and when she finally met Judy she was so supportive of her. badass movie I love Kris Kristofferson... he is a wonderful actor and did a wonderful job in this movie. As a musician, he's just as amazing and most certainly legendary. However, I wish Elvis had been able to do this movie. It would have provided a level of "peace" to all the grief that was caused him by the movies and soundtracks that were forced on him. Streisand wanted Elvis... this role was practically made for him and it would have given us something "dramatic" from Elvis' movie library. The reason Elvis wasn't able to do this movie was because of the con man Parker and his bullshit. I truly believe that had Elvis worked with Streisand he would have learned so much from her (not just acting but business!) and wised up to "The Colonels" ways... especially at that point when Parker was taking 50% of Elvis' earnings. So many have asked "do you think Elvis could have gotten in shape". The answer is yes, without question. Elvis was used to crash diets buts the importance of the film would have been drive enough, trust me that it would've happened. the first love making on the movie was so arousing it was  Great Man I wish Elvis had done this movie.
Stay Hungry 	Arnold and Jeff in one movie..Now I've seen it all )) This trailer doesn't make any sense Oh I could just lick Sally Field all over!!! This trailer is so confusing, but young Jeff Bridges looks so delicious. Dhe amount of ritually-sickled hammers he had to temper in order to get where he is, dhough... Glad you like the film If you have an appetite for life.....Stay Hungry! Thank you ARNOLD for inspiring me to Stay Hungry! Jovem Nerd :) Why does Arnold look so small in this movie!?! They should of bulked him up! 2:35 Arnold really looks thin, was it 14kg hes lost weight on this. its looks so bad... its goto be good! now we just need someone to upload the full edit to watch! i thought they had mixed 2 separate movies into one clip.. wonderful movie, totally different to arnolds usual action stuffand 100% worth watching! Movie does have Sally Field's perfect bubble butt naked... These days you see everything in the trailer.  back then you had not idea what the fuck you just saw because they seemed to toss scenes on the floor pick them up at random and go here is your trailer.  anybody know the name of the song to wich arnold and ken waller pose to? 30 pounds Well, it is filmed in the "Ham", and one of the few movies from that era...Not much has changed since then... Arnie actually won golden globe from his role. I dont know how the fuck Arnold made it in the Movies after that Shit!! and the Director told him to loose 20pounds!!! FFS
The Story of David 	What is the thing called that David used to swing the rock in ??? David picked up 3 stones bside the stream All glory to GOD alone.... the real goliath is bigger than my house this is so faaaar away from what bible says...pity, ugly david, in this movie David look so scared !, actually bible says he under estimate Goliath because he knows what he is doing. This movie can not reconstruct the story. This movie is only about the logic today not the ancient logic. The director should learn from troy movie. guess now palestinians use sling against which giant? ''give to him his sword(the mind) and all is forgiven!'' Love this so much One of the keys to this whole thing is the Sea Peoples (Philistines among others) had iron weapons. Bronze was mostly used at this time. goliath was bigger than that chimp this is history is fake when acompear with the really history in the bible i am wishing you good life As all biblical movies doesn't match what the Bible says exactly but it's good they have made this at least we get a bit of a picture how it could've probably looked! I wish someone out there would produce a detailed very accurate account of what took place there between David and Goliath. The hero lost in this story. Rip Goliath it doesn't took one shot to take goliath down The moral of the story is, girls guys who are short can still be stronger than those who are 6 feet tall.
Stroszek 	Wo landen diese Sachen? Wo landen diese Instrumente? Believe it or not, Ratatat's LP4 brought me here. I was curious to know what the movie is about, I'll give it a watch. Filme Maravilhoso !!!!! Supposedly Ian curtis watched this before he killed himself... Supposedly Ian curtis watched this before he killed himself... kiitos I normally dislike those "blah blah blah brought you here" but out of respect, I'll say it anyhow and keep this short.Thank you, Keanu Reeves. Is very sad... To think... this movie put an end to Joy Division! HOLY SHIT FUCK
Taxi Driver 	Sad to see a trailer for a masterpiece like this, and to know just how far down the shitter the American Movie Machine has come. How the hell do you go from this, to Power Rangers, Transformers, endless super hero movies,  more Fast and Furious.. I think it says a lot that in the 70s self aware movies like these were being made consistently, that asked difficult questions about society and its ugliness. Today's shit is just escapist hoorah cookie cutter kitch. Where did we go wrong? Going to be a sad day for cinema, and American cinema in particular when Scorsese dies. That soundtrack transports me Taxi Driver is a reflection of our reality and the potential crazy people in it. I don't think any movie in history will ever showcase or duplicate that as good as Taxi Driver did. I can relate to this character so much lol Je suis Travis Helloooo yyyyoutubers watch Taaaaxi Driver online here => https://twitter.com/2bd3240f7d8a92ff1/status/822769129585184768 I remember not liking this movie as much as everybody else did and to this day I still don't love it , I appreciate it and I definitely enjoyed it but for me it not really re-watchable as maybe for other people , but I will definitely say one thing I loved about this movie... it Robert De Niro's exceptional performance as Travis Bickle , To be honest when I really think about it I enjoyed his performance way more then Peter Finch performance in Network , I think Network is a better film but performance wise De Niro has to do it for me. Taxi Driver is simply put a masterpiece FUCKING ICONIC Hi, working a little project, and been looking for some for some true 70's film overlays as seen 0:01 - 0:04. So far no luck, all the content found on you tube for 35mm overlay samples just seem unauthentic. Any ideas? Thanks Scorsese. Greatest film that I've had ever scene, inspired me to write. Not a scene wasted. scorsbe is the truth. If anyone is interested in a piece Errol Flynn's bathtub, contact me! =))))) jodie foster dont get the credit she deserve , one of the best actress ever im watching the movie, but i wont see trailer. Because it will spoil me haha i love the vibe that this movie has and the acting is good as well, but the story line is shit tbh
That's Entertainment, Part II And Kathryn Grayson 	Is One Of My Fvaorites I Seen Gene Kelly And Fred Astaire And Ginger Rogers In There Movies That's Entertainment Is One Of My Favorite Movie Musicals
To the Devil a Daughter 	good ol lee The Exorcist was 1973, but who's counting! LOL! This film could have put "Hammer" back at the top but a rather ludicrous ending and pointless blood-letting let the proceedings down badly. LOL this is one of the movies i seen when i was a teenager at the ADAMS theater in Newark NJ, they would show 3 Kung Fu films w/ either 3 horror or 3 sci fi, and then if you were old enough you went to NEW EXPERIENCE up the street(BRICK CITY peeps know what i'm talking about LOL) and now this is my first time seeing it since the early 80"s, well the previews anyway, it's on here for view at $3 LOL how about that, i paid $3 to see five  movies plus this one 33 years ago and now ima pay $3 to see just this one LOL. . . . .weird. This actually looks kind of good... A much better film that given credit for. Wrongly called a pale Omen ripoff. Hammer Films? Will ther ever be a time I can watch stuff on your channel? Its a really good trailer. It's quite a good movie. Just the climax lets it down! Christopher lee is fantastic in it! It came out years ago. The most noteworthy feature was a nude scene by Ms. Kinski that was borderline jail-bait.
The Town That Dreaded Sundown 	dont say it dont think it BEN! meh So... a gravelly voiced killer with a history and what looks like burn scars on his face, killing teens and terrorizing a young woman in order to "make them remember"... I'm wondering if these murders take place on or around Elm Street. do not enter after dark...can't be more obvious than that This movie actually wasn't bad. >guy dies>SCREAMS WHILE STANDING STILL AND WATCHING this movie was really lame His name was Jason would u look at that its richard from gilmore girls I wonder if I'll ever get to see a horror film that isn't about some young, "hot and sexy" woman getting gratuitously naked and terrified/butchered. The town that dreaded sundown, or village that sustained pillage, or city without much  pity, or... The Phantom Killer sounds almost like Kylo Ren the classic make out scene Make them remember that remakes of classic scary motion pictures are usually dreadful, pieces of shit, mostly watched after sun up, in an empty discount theatre, or more often on a free video hosting website. one of the best slasher film of all time loved it so much . This movie is a numerology goldmine.  11's and 8's encoded everywhere.  Fav's of intelligence operations. The bogey man has pretty eyes I thought this one was miles better than the original. The original was so boring. It's not like it was slow with some build up of tension, it was just boring. The original movie is FUCKIN MASTERPIECE. This remake just sucked cock.
Tracks 	I just saw this movie, Beautifully Done . The force( dark side) is strong in this movie. (lol). Kylo Ren's Vacation In Jakku The trailer looks great with music and stuff, but I watched some very similar movie, possibly made by the same director, which was utterly pessimistic movie. This simply seems to be a little more fancier version of this. Definitely won't recommend. Why watch dysfunctional being almost die due own dysfunctional neural networks in her brain and then accidentally won't die and for her misery lives on. One can relate to Robyn's internal struggle against the past and the identity of the self in a rapidly changing society... Ask me why I no longer watch the "Academy Awards", and I say, "Because master pieces like Tracks was never even mentioned". this is not the tracks i was looking for the one i was looking for was about a njt train derailment climax women movie Another "strong, independent woman" film? Enough of these already. Someone who can tell me where I can watch the full list movie I only managed to watch about half of the movie, can anyone tell me what happened at the end? its speachless movie..its stole my heart does anyone know any other films like this one and into the wild? Camel abuse and an annoying woman after i watched this, i kinda hate people This film inspired me much and I made a small not so heavy and risky trip by myself in mountains. It have been the happiest time for the long years. I had also some unpleasant dangerous situations, but God thanks avoided any bad things at the end. And this film with its feeling is a real pearl in cinematography. M83 - Outro.the song is really good ! Alice runs away from Wonderland and ends up in Jakku, where she falls in love with Kylo Ren Reminded of the movies ( wild ) ( into the wild ) looks good. I love Mia Wasikowska.  She's such a great actress!
Tunnel Vision 	is this coming out So when is the movie actually gonna be out? Like I've been waiting for a year and still no mivbir Wtf are they waiting for just release the damn movieeee OMG where can i watch it ??? I'm going crazyyyyyy affff Release this shit Any one know where I can watch this now?! omg where can I watch it? is it ever gonna get released. So confuse :/ I'm disappointed...I thought it was a movie about Eazy's  life This is gonna be good . Where the fuck can I get this damn movie Fuck the Tunnel Vision is cool so what happened? it was supposed to be released may 20th 2016. one year later, still not released damn dude he should really pursue a career in acting! He's fucking bad ass with those eyes! So is this movie coming out or???? 0:36 How I'm feelin about 'Tunnel Vision' producers, who are keeping Gerald all for themselves When does this movie come out? Haven't heard anything of it I heard that this movie will be ONLINE on 24.11.2016 From my understanding the movie started getting a lot of attention from the big shots so they had to push it back. I think to improve it more.
Two-Minute Warning 	I take it they used "Generic Football" teams...?  ...Unlike"Black Sunday *('77)"....? Caught in the Catastrophic +Crosshairs+ of '70's Suspense! ... As we all know, our main-man Heston disastrously blew off Dick Donner's open invitation to boldly bare his ample chest against the sinister forces of the Antichrist; opting instead to constitutionally bear his arms in Peerce's polyester-primer for recreational sniping in professional sports venues. Hands down, notwithstanding Shavelson's "The Pigeon That Took Rome", this deliciously campy slice of Bicentennial Cheesecake is easily Charlton's funniest screen performance by a gun-totin' country mile, I reckon. Earnestly removing his sunglasses whenever he is about to dress down some poor schmuck, I was half-expecting his trademark teardrop shades to magically lift off his head, neatly attached to his ultra-stylish Charles Grodin-caliber toupee, a la SCTV''s "Rabbi Karlov". So gently set down your dog-eared copy of "Guns & Ammo" and hitch a heavy-ord ce ride on Captain America's "Chuck"- Wagon. "Oy Vey!" ...
Up! 	The best movie ever!!! I loved all the characters.. GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW IF YOU DIDN'T YET!! GO!! In my opinion, this is the best Pixar film yet to date!  the creators of toy story?! ofcourse this movie is good then can anyone tell the music name  from 0:26 please please i am looking this for several weeks and i can't find i LOVE Russell.:Dlooks just like my baby boy.(:Lmaooo.(: this is an amazing moviewith both sad and funny mommentsfantastic movie POINT! What's this music from??  The cool adventury music during the arial scenes?  It's not from the soundtrack. A guy I hang around with tried to convince me that this movie was unrealistic because the house would not have got off the ground or fly level. I don't think he realized that it is for children.  i cried so many times. this is an amazing movie. the beginning killed me. Amazing movie 1:59 Lol 1st time iv'e cried in a long time.. I remember watching this trailer over and over again to see Kevin's part! I would always crack up laughing. I still do! haha made me cry a LOT. but its a fantastic movie, words cant describe how much I love it I always cry in the beginning  SQUIRREL!  I cry on pixar films :L This movie made me cry. No Disney movie has ever done that. Not even Bambi. Good story,good animation,good characters and good movie
Victory at Entebbe 	So fantastic.love  it guys i wana watch full movie so pliz tell me where exactly to find this movie ,,pliz help I love Elizabeth Taylor's "emotions" so touching..... Where did you find this gem? I've been looking for this version FOREVER! I remember watching this with a bud of mine when we were teenagers. He was lusting after Linda Blair, and we were both laughing at the bossy Nazi lady. (And Helen Hayes, playing Jewish !!? That's like casting Kevin Bacon as Jewish).  I also love the Klaus Kinski version called OPERATION THUNDERBOLT, but its hard to get and the MGM vhs version is out of print , cheers friend saw it on tv just now.  very good film.  raid on entebbe is good too good film and i use to have it on vhs
Vigilante Force 	Kris Kristofferson's character breaks up a fight in this and he follows it up with a terrific line: "You let the police do the hitting; we can get away with it!" I LOVE IT! "It was a typical American town, until they found they were sitting on a half of billion dollars worth of oil. They called it "God's Country," until all hell broke loose...then it was time for VIGILANTE FORCE!"
W.C. Fields and Me 	W.C. was the best of his time. His gags, writing and perspectives were far more gutsy than any comedian today. Charlie Chaplin today is a clown... WC is still clever. Everyone's an expert until they stand on stage. "Before I go, let me tell of an ancient Persian Poet...yes my dear he was a Popular Past Persian Poet by the name of Omar....he had a line in camels...single handedly invented the caravan...where would our holidays be without him....in any case a line of one of his poems is great in wisdom. He said "BRAVE is the MUSIC of a DISTANT Drum"...and that shows the character of a critic.....a critic is like a eunuch in one of those hareems...he know what they're doing...but he can't do it himself.." Before I go let me leave you with a bit of fatherly advice.... Never dry your arse with a white towel. Movie ruined by cocaine use...on the set. Rod Steiger  is great There was one major problem with this film of the funniest man ever...it wasn't funny, at all. Script! Steiger is brilliant; movie is so historically inaccurate. Shame... Rod Steiger was a versatile actor, able to play historic figures as diverse as W C Fields, Napoleon, Mussolini and Al Capone. steiger was also brilliant as napoleon to whoever wrote low quality crap  get a real liofe jackass Damn Steiger was good. No surprise there....but he IS Fields in this!  Damn I'd like to see this whole film - released on DVD in widescreen format. Steiger did a fine job with the roll. but the script was based on his girlfriend Carlotta Monti's book about him, which seemed to---ahem---stretch the truth just a bit.  She likes to talk about how she was with him at the end, but truth is that she was out of his life at the time of his death.  Plus, she tries to make it seem like his on and off screen character was pretty much the same.  Although sometimes similar, he was reportedly more low key and tender off screen than this movie shows.   This movie is an abomination to the memory of the Great Bill Fields.Benny Hill did the best impersonation. Rod Steiger certainly was a versatile actor. He could play equally well very diverse historical figures. I mean how different are Al Capone, Napoleon, Mussolini and W C Fields. Yep, thats the one. You can get the complete movie by clicking the blue link in the info box. I think I remember this movie, did it end with him saying "I wish it would rain"  then his p.a. turned a hosepipe onto the tin roof?
Rod 	was brilliant, thanks for the link, the only stuff on the market is the still and a paper back. Click the blue link next to the video screen to get the complete movie.
Wanted 	This move felt like a Matrix ripoff in my opinion. I enjoyed it but it had so many similarities to the Matrix. So many that I would take up a lot of time naming them all. *SPOILER ALERT*Anyone else found hidden messages in the film? I found one when he went to work and discovers a note on the post about the Trash and rats behind it is a poster that says "Your Father's (Son)" before he looked at the house across his Apartment which belonged to his well Father. This is one of the most fun and awesome movie ever! Go watch it, you'll love it! "Shoot this mother fucker" are the most un natural words to come out of Morgan Freeman's mouth Damn good movie. Split makes me want to re-watch all McAvoy stuff really soon. i love james so much *yawn* boring I just watched this (McAvoy fan here) and I must say I enjoyed it waaay more than I thought I would, even though I watched on my laptop. The stunts were pretty cool, and I love an action movie with lots of comic relief. I rate this a 7 out of 10 - but keep in mind I don't watch a lot of action movies, so it might rate a little lower with those who do. Anyway, it's definitely worth watching. this is so laggy Split reminded me of this curve the bullet rofl sloan is a gullible fuck, lol this movie sucks but Im watching it right now so I need to finish it.  The train derailing scene was fake as shit. What's the music please to the opening scene Angelina is my bay. I'm just in love with this woman, who is 22 years older than me . Oh God!!! to different from the comic book. supposed to be villans that killed off at the batman types and now run things however they made it pg 2:01 Fuck you :D I fuck with this movie so hard.
A Whale of a Tale 	This is interesting because I sometimes wonder if such a film actually exists!
The Winds of Autumn 	Good movie, Thank you. Looking forward smaller screen than this ! "an adventurous drama that has appeal for young viewers".  ???    Murder and rape in the first 20 minutes. Are you serious ? Little different, but good entertainment. Thanks for sharing good movie.  thanks Threw a shotgun away. Did not go through pockets for money. Did not collect the horses and guns to sell. Are they crazy or what
The Witch Who Came from the Sea 	One crazy movie This movie is efffffffed One of the few older B-horror movies in which the bad acting and film making actually makes things disturbing instead of just funny (the ironic title which hardly has anything to do with the movie). A 10 on the "what the hell?" meter! Strongly recommend this "video nasty" that was banned in Britain where do I find this film. looks good with Anna Frank Mirror. Father. Mirror. Father. Mirror. Father. Mirror. Father. Mirror. Father. Mirror. Father. Mirror. Father. Fin. muito foda! legal!
Won Ton Ton 	is it happy movie or sad. I didn't see this before This was just released on Blu-Ray from Olive Films. One of the biggest bombs of the 1970's, I saw it on TV in the 80's as a kid, @SchizoidMan100 It was released to DVD in 2008.  Look on Amazon; brand news copies are available for as low as $2.70. Anyone know where I can get the movie?  I tried VHS, DVD, D/l and I am still SOL!
Young Pioneers' Christmas 	Wonderful!! What strength they had!! Thank you' do very much for sharing !! HOLY WIFE IS SO GORGEOUS. Amazing personality- HE'S so lucky he MET a woman like that. She's phenomenal. GREAT STORY...MUST WATCH!!!! Wow...Very good endurance and strength for a couple so young! Filme maravilhoso!Tem dublado ou legendado? back in 1978 my grandpa, mom n dad n older sister and i watched this on tv. great family movie 4 all. tyvm for upload :) Mm the neighbors are not old 40 and 30 no way This is probably the sweetest movie I've ever seen. I absolutely loved it! I had such a crush on Linda Purl.  What a beauty. They only got married in their teens because the life expectancy was age 45 and people couldn't afford to wait till their 20s, also 1 in 6 women died in childbirth then and the younger the woman was the less likely she was to die in childbirth. Now the life expectancy is age 80 and older women over 35 can safely give birth so there's no need for teen girls having babies anymore, teen girls today can now go to college, work on getting a career, and can now grow up into their own person.Times actually are better now. Based on the novel by Rose Wilder Lane -- Laura Ingalls Wilder's daughter! same here! so happy for netty at the end! SHUT THE DOOR1 d movie js a lot to teach us. and it is not tainted with obscenities at all. a great movie show strength courage desire determination anybody have the young pioneers Christmas movie, I like that one too, please post it too What a sweet movie! Life was very hard back then. Into the 1970's the most common age for marriage in the U.S was 17 for girls.
The Zebra Force 	The sequel "Oreo Force" is better. 1:12 is the most pro part of that special force <.<
3 Women 	One of my favorite movies . My interpretation of the movie is that Pinky (sissy spacek) is fascinated when she sees twins who dress and act the same so she meets Mille (Shelley duvall) and starts to cling on to her and ends up being her roommate and that's when things get strange. It started off as a rather light movie and then became more and more dramatic. '3 Women' is an American classic.  It is sort of like Claude Chabrol's 'Les bonnes femmes' which follows the lives of 3 working girls in Paris.  In Chabrol's film turmoil is brought into the lives of the three women by an evil stranger, whereas in Altman's film, things change with women change amid turmoil not because of an evil stranger but because of their interactions with each other. Dreamy weird movie based on a dream.  I love Millie's apartment, too! I first saw this when I was a teenager and it freaked me out very badly.  It made me very upset. But i dont know why. Prolly because it starts out like a comedy but then it gets dramatic. This film feels like a prequel of The Shining & Carrie Combined. Such a Great work of art! One of my favorite films! Love the inter play between Duvall & Spacek , and the music contributes to the feeling of unease. It's a film like Mulholland Drive you don't often know whats going on but enjoy the ride. Happy birthday Shelly Duvall  One of my favorite movies. Shelly Duvall performance is on my top ten of all time. Carrie and Wendy Torrance?Stephen King approves. I love Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacek and Altman. One of the best films ever no doubt. isn't it awkward when you reply to someone in youtube and then they answered back with something really nice and then you don't know what else to say? it gets so awkward hahahahah sorry, oh and i know this is so random but i am re watching this movie right now and im so scared of ghost for no reason, when im in my apartment alone watching this I can see why :) shelly has one of the most distinctive faces in cinema history along with sissy. I think she has always been gorgeous, but to most people her type of beauty isn't conventional/sexy like the public want. But us in the design world loveeeee her. Rookie brought me here.
ABBA overrated 	never watched this so just wondering... why not just take a dna test if you don't konw who the dad is? I watched this in 2008 when it first came out and (not kidding) I don't remember shit Great but i really want to know the song in this trailer in 1:04 s. please! I really want to watch the mama mia movie I really want to watch the mama mia movie Special memories, because I visited the islands in 2014. Seeing the movie in an outdoor cinema, seeing the same sky and stars on the screen and in real time. That gives a special feeling. And because of the storm (15-6-2014), I Always remember these weeks as a special holiday. Worst movie ever seen "I used to have fun" "Oh we know"That line jajajaja This was a great film!! Like if you agree!!! ;P Donna and her squad = squad goals GREECE..... she is the bestjust like Vanessa Hudgenso.m.glove her love mama mia best film ever  AMANDA SEYFRIED IS THE BEST ACTRICE  EVER
The Bees 	Y O U  L I K E  J A Z Z ? she dumped a man for a beea bee Hate bees, but good movie. Don't worry about that honey little bee (Barry) considering most of American honey is syrup. Y A  L I K E  J A Z Z WTF! at 1:01 thats not barry thats the testing bee also named barry plus he fat bruh how does dreamwork mess up their own damn trailer!?!?!??! I've never been so scared to scroll down the comments does he even realise that if he stings anyone he will die? privelaged white woman beats Mexican male 0:38 police called and Mexican has been arrested. art 1:00 if Barry stung that person Barry would be committing suicide because when bees sting people they die YOU LIKE JAHAZZZZZZXZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzsgyjasdzx c U  KLL EKIIK   JAAZZZZZZZ My favorite movie quote "ya like jazz" better then Maya the bee movie Maya the bee movie is worse of the worse The Bee Movie but its normal *Ya like jazz?* 0:19 Those ain't no winter boots, nibba those are timbs. ya like jazz You like jazz?! Yee
Aces High 	You  got to remember that it was filmed in  1976 before any advances in cgi. .yes its a bit corny but it is better than  flyboys A Fabulous Film. A one off. This is THE best,  saddest, and most authentic, WW1 flying movie EVER made. A pity the whole thing is not on youtube. Great movie, dreadful trailer. 0:18 it's a cock and balls
Adventures of a Private Eye 	Great scream at 23:11. Thank you for posting this.  I haven't seen it in years and was hoping someone would!
The Alien Factor 	this movie was friggin awesome, I love the hell out of it. Wow my parents had this recorded on tape when I was a kid I used to watch this movie and enjoyed it so much. Could known what movie was called until I founded wow I def want this movie I remember reading about this movie in Famous Monsters of Filmland in 1978. I've always been interested in watching it. One of the BEST film soundtrack off ALL Time! I would describe this movie as a film shot in 35mm by a director who thought he was shooting in Super 8. It looks exactly like a movie 12 year olds would shoot in 8mm. The dialog, acting, everything reeks of a Super 8 home movie. I oughta know, I was once one of those little brats with a movie camera. But having said that it's still 100x better than the garbage sci fi and horror movies being made now. Sci fi and horror films now are so generic and blah. No style whatsoever. a timeless masterpiece One of the WORST movies ever! I luv watchin cinematic titanics version! : ) I LOVE Tom Griffith in this movie!!  Ive seen enough! Awesome.For me,Dohler made some of the greatest trashy horror films ever.Can't decide between this and Nightbeast as i love them both so much :D Kinda makes me wish that I would have been born earlier, and to different country, cos I love these kind of films. These days, when you get cheap scifi/horror stuff, it's some Syfy-channell crap that has nothing in them, no ideas or same kind of charm. This movie has a peculiar sentimental value for me, as it represented the day my childhood nightmares ended. I'd watched this on TV one Saturday afternoon in the early 80s, and afterward my unconscious seized on the alien at the 1:28 mark for use as as dream symbol. It placed this creature, shrunken and dormant, in a burlap bag hanging in my closet, and told me that it represented my nightmares. From that night on, I never had another! :-) this movie is soo boring The 70s Factor: idiots wasting good money to produce films like this. I'd wanted to track it down so badly, nice to find it again! I saw this on TV back around 1985 or so! It was like watching paint dry, but it did cause me to have a really cool dream that ended my nightmares! For that reason alone, it has sentimental value for me, and I'd love to see it again! Now it is naive, no youth like watching!! Cinematic Titanic did this in Dallas in June and it was very funny!! They should release this on dvd before the year's up.. Thanks for watching. Just have one correction. It is Perry Hall not Pine Hall. Count Gore is the one killed at 1:25 in this trailer. He has a website at countgore com. It's a Leemoid.
The Alpha Incident Agreed.. 	it's a surprisingly good little low budget sci-fi flick.  I LOVE the spooky synth score, too, regardless of how cheesy it may sound to modern ears. They just don't make them like they used to, huh? we watching the same flick?alpha incident is gold Never really liked this movie. It was bad even for a bad movie. But not entertainingly bad. Just kinda... boringBut the Redneck guy was awesome. :D
Amar Akbar 	Anthony so good 6 din nhi chellegi I hope it's true inshahallah movie flop ho jaegi agar ye teeno sath me aye to , mere hisaab se amar salman , akbar govinda and anthony  akshay kumar ban jaye to movie super hit ho sakti hai Amir should b akbar Anthony should b sharukh amitabh was tall teeno boar hai hero I hope is true we Wait for three Khan in one movie wow nice It's not possible 1000 crore ka budget lena padega ful garm aisa kabhi bhi nahi ho sakta hai we would like to watch three Khan's love you all khans
The Amazing Howard Hughes 	Nice upload.  Does anyone know how to get a copy of the full movie?  Yes, there are 3 parts to this, but the original was longer. Wow- the young Tommy Lee Jones ! Thanks for the upload. I've been said to have 'schizo-OCD' by one shrink and apparently this is what H.H. had too.. I wonder how true that is though. Howard Hughes was a very advanced person for the time, innovative and great businessman, man of his word and proved it with the creation of the world's largest plane, showing flying, leaving the mouth open more than one. This film is a lot longer. I wish I could find the full version. The dvd is edited and there's great scenes missing, like when Hughes landed in the water down South and was jailed because he had no I.D. If anyone has it out there,I'd buy it. Tommy Lee Jones was 31 when he did this. BEAUTIFUL, another long lost movie FOUND. Martin Scorsese's The Aviator was superb and Leonardo Dicaprio was excellent as opposed to the comment below BUT ALWAY'S wanted to see the original with the great Tommy Lee Jones, thank you for posting this. the way of the future, the way of the future :-) Show me all the blueprints... This television film was originally presented over two nights. I was 15 when I first saw it and became interested in the life of Mr. Hughes. While there is some dramatic license taken (a P-38 standing in for the XF-11), the film is fairly accurate. I wish Glenn Odekirk had given permission for his name to be used. Of course, everyone knew the "Wilbur Peterson" character was actually Odie.Tommy Lee Jones turns in an excellent performance as the disturbed Howard Hughes. You see how much the XF-11 crash affected Howard and how it led to his descent into the misuse of pain killers. 2nd or 3rd i am not sure ha first!
The Amsterdam Kill 	This Golden Harvest movie kind of reminds me of Shaw's (and Hammer's) "Shatter."

Annie Hall 	Happy 40th Anniversary Annie Hall This comment section is full of antisemitic assholes who can't comprehend the genius of Woody Allen. I mean, I love Star Wars too, guys, it's a fun movie and all, but Annie Hall is a brilliant postmodern tale of love. And fuck you if you can't understand that. A great movie celebrating it's 40th year anniversary this year 2017 - celebrate with us #woodyallenretro I really want to say all of Woody Allen's movies that if Woody Allen acts a main character ,it would drop down the quality of his movie. help im in love with my fiance and why is this fish back on my screeen good lord someone is out for me tonihgt! Fuck you all, go back to your caves and watch Star Wars movies like these are too deep for you to understand I wanted to watch this, but this trailer made me feel nervous and on edge. Yeah, what a turrible film.  Needs more splosions. Best film in 1977 according to Oscars. Yeah right, Star Wars should of course have won it. What is this really  about? That guy keep changing girls all the time? no idea if this is good movie or not but after watching this trailer there's no way I will Its one of my absolute fav even though i admit i don't get quite a few jokes. This movie has such an amazing influence even to this day cinema. Eh, living with Woody Allen must've been better than living with Michael. This, Cloverfield and Breakfast At Tiffany's are my favourite films about love...  note: not HD The most boring trailer I ever saw! I love this film so much!
Are You Being Served? 	Several scenes  are taken from the TV series, the cast seem to pause for laughs, not good. hahahaha...Good Don't bother...this movie is a load of old rubbish. Just watch the regular series. The trailer didn't seem too keen but being a fan of the show, I'd still like to see it. Can't find it here in the US. Haha. Looks all very dated now but still good fun. Thank you very much for uploading! Have never seen it as can't find it over in nz oh no your so wrong , the movie is fantastic. Don't understand how they made such a bad movie from such a great show and comically talented cast!! The movie was awful but the show is great.
Audrey Rose 	fake ass The Exorcist rip off This is a great movie and the book sequel is also outstanding. I think a lot of people are right about this film. it's not a horror. but it's psychological. it's about love for your family and terror for what happens to them. I loved this movie sadly I cannot track it down nowadays. Anthony Hopkins was brilliant in this. and true it's a very underrated film. it's needs to be remastered And Ivy's nightmares always increased in October, the month Audrey Rose died...I was born in the month of October so I remember this on my birthday. I'm watching this now on Comcast streampix!!! Love 70's horror films...... Also The initiation of sara This was an excellent film that was severely underrated by the movie critics.  I've watched it more than once, and I never grow tired of watching it again. we all had many bodies before. many parents, many siblings and we will continue after we pass from this life. We are simply changing bodies just like how we change our clothes. as the clothes get old and worn out, we simply discard them and get new clothes.  This is how the lifecycle work. Read the Bhagavata Gita, Lord Krishna explains in detail what reincarnation is all about. I sorta want there to be a remake... just because I want Misha Collins to play Audrey's dad Amazing movie, and so underrated. More of a spiritual film than horror Love this movie, there was the opening and end credits to the score on youtube but I don't see them now or not even a score uploaded anywhere. I'd like to hear the music again. 'It will alter your ideas about life and death' which is very true. After watching this awful trailer, I had a hankering to be six feet under myself! Anthonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Very good movie!!! Enjoyed it very much. Great acting - Anthony Hopkins. The this...the that... Anthony Hopkins was beautiful!
Bare Knuckles 	bbw wrestlings Ok .......... As much as some women do like to be protected, not all men protect. Women can be just as independent as men in all situations, including the ring. Girls, if they desire, have a right to fight.  they were all real fighters fak yu Streets of Rage this looks like a home made movie why do they have to have girls fighting, in movies or real life. to me a woman is somebody worth fighting for, not having them fight each other. of course i was raised in a different time, where women were smart and pretty and didn't want to fight. they were happy being with a guy who could and should pertect them. this will be such a stupid movie. Hollywood is clueless about fight scenes.  Especially female fight scenes.  Bad lighting, too many cut-aways, bad camera work, inept "fighters/models."  You name it, they get it wrong. They should make sequel, starring Xena's Renee O'Conner (Gabrielle.) Were there no real fighters available for these roles? who would pay to see this shit  gonna be horrible with bad fight choreography and acting awesome
Between the Lines 	this looks like  a young puny version of will smith doing a modern day smith movie @juxtaPOW preciate that  bro.  @Agweho more on the way...thanks for the love.  THis the guy from facebook was taken. black man dying as a trailer??? I couldn't wait til I got home to watch!  And I'm glad I didn't.  You did your thing in this one homey! Look out Denzel Washingmachine! I bet he get the Oscar for most Grammies for one video!

Billy Jack Goes to Washington 	Sounds like Trey Gowdy. I think that's Edward James Olmos at 2:04 Trailor's bad enough. Don't think I'll bother looking at the movie. I wish Billy Jack's son will come out and clean house today. it's extremely dirty nowadays. Billy Jack is rolling in his grave. he did all that hard work for nothing. And this movie is pretty much why Tom McClaughlin could get no media coverage the 4 times he ran for president :P I love Billy. Jack This movie sucked a dick. I saw this movie for the first time when I was around twelve years old and I have never forgotten this amazing movie. like it or hate it   this movie  still got people thinking.  after one of my teachers saw the film  we had a class discussion on politicians and corruption  very  thought provoking   R.I.P. Tom The current crop of republicons are the reason things have gotten so bad. Only concerned for THEMSELVES and the RICH! rip my friend and comrade in arms and belive it or nt he was a secretservice agent  how do i no because i new him The problem is that in reality he wouldn't have got three words out before they had him out of there, most likely never to be seen again. That's why it's so important to use the medium of movies to stir up the hearts of the people. R.I.P. Billy Jack. Its amazing 40 years later and it still resonates only Big Government is way worse. Interesting. It looks like the shoe is on the other foot in 2014. What a piece of CRAP. Tom Laughlin the ultimate Rebel, you go Billy Jack.
Black Joy 	2:18:-) can some one upload this on U tube ?! why thw accents? such rasist times! New Beat check this beat out real quick, if u like it be sure to subscribe!
Black Market Baby 	where can I buy))
Black Oak Conspiracy 	this would make a great double feature with jonathan demme's fighting mad with peter fonda. in real life actor albert salami murdered his wife and then killed himself. salami was a reoccurring character on daniel boone. darby hinton played daniel boone's son and he also appears as a miner who get beaten up by the great jesse vint.
Bobby Deerfield 	what is the name of the song?please help me An underrated and extremely sensitive Al Pacino movie because it requires  loads of patience to understand it. The beautiful background score also adds to the charm of this movie @Shaakira West 3 years late to your comment. But ugh, tell me about it LOL!! I just watched it for the first time and I hated it. I didn't get the point of this movie (if there was any). It did not make any sense to me. Bobby was like a ghost throughout the movie, half-dead, not excited about anything, not caring about his girlfriend or his family or anything really. And the girl was so annoying. Crazy weirdo. And their whole relationship seemed just wrong since the beginning till the end. He started this weird romance while he was still in a relationship with another woman. It was just all wrong.. I can't think of any reason why they even made this movie The booming and popular "beautiful woman dying" genre finally produced a good movie. this trailer is terrible. I kept laughing at the guy talking. But the film is good..lol I like this movie, so much Al pacino at 29 so damn fine  I've been told Pacino is "shew" or "shoo" or "shoe" or "shue" or "sheau" in Bobby Deerfield. a very, very good movie!
A Bridge Too Far 	ahhhh... back in the days when you found out about upcoming movies by watching the trailers before other movies... How does Sean Connery look older than in The Rock (1996)? This movie's a complete waste of 3 hrs., regardless of the jerry's final loss. holy shit even in 1977 they gave away too much in the trailers... one of the best war movies of all time, they don't make movies like this anymore Notice that the preview is made for a much longer attention span than we have today!! love that ' FIRE' My dad was an extra in this fucking movie. He's sitting behind Robert Redford in the fucking boat when they're crossing the river. See Ideal Alpha Best The Deepest Christianity Meaning of Nazi Germany HOOK CROSS SWASTIKA Symbol. Dirk Bogarde's character, General "BOY" Browning was one of the main reasons that Market Garden failed. He scheduled his HQ Company in the first wave of Gliders. Thousands of non-combatants who could have been replaced by the Polish Brigade or some Front-Line troops. First few clips, Dirk Bogarde as General "Boy" Browning. This prick included his HQ division in the first drop! Can you believe that? Over 10,000 troops in his HQ who could have been in the fighting. The failure was as much down to him as anything. He also reportedly knew that the SS Armoured Divs were refitting in the area and ignored this intelligence. Man, that cast! They had every classic actor except Troy McClure! Royalty "coward", stayed behind, he sacrificed the nation was considered low, with arrogantly .... this is only a small and insignificant ... never feel guilty .... "arrogant" is his destiny In other words: The Sundance Kid, tries valiantly to reach Hannibal Lecter after Peter the Great and a Toy Designer separate him from James Bond.  The Jackal and Gonville Bromhead team up with Sonny Corleone and Monica and Ross;s dad to reach Ali McGraw's squeeze before Popeye Doyle and Dr Sparrow fall out.  King Henry V pleads for sanity. the soundtrack is so great, classic war lid This has one of the best casts of any film that I have ever seen. And Ryan O'Neal. 2 days they said, we've been here nein (9) I watched this film on opening day.  Not many other people did.   War movies were still out of favor in '77. The CGI is fantastic because is not CGI, is actual scenery. The last WW2 movie will an all star cast. To see Anthony Hopkins play Colonel Frost..and then 15 years later play Hannibal Lechter?
Brothers 	great fight between brothers!!! really nice movie It is better 2 watch " Warrior " than brothers .

How many staff are employed at the theater? I went to a screening of this film in Paris and saw Princess Grace: utterly lovely and beautiful. what is the boys name the main one that is 13 old good times
The Choirboys 	Joseph Wambaugh, the author of the novel, sued the makers of this film on account of it being such a terrible adaptation. Read the book. The novel was great. The movie sucks. There's no cops left..
Close Encounters of the Third Kind 	I haven't seen this movie yet. Is it good? This year is the 40th anniversary I...I have freaking Goosebumps if i were you watch " star crystal 1986 " this is the best sci-fi space film ive ever seen. no sci-fi movies can surpass this movie! the special effects is great. the acting is truly convincing. the story really very good! this should get the best award ! close encounters of the third kind, sunshine, interstellar, Apollo 18, attack the block, 2001: a space odyssey, the martian, moon, gravity, solaris, Europa report are pure garbage's movies. all of this are worst  fucking dullest, worthless and boringliest film ive ever seen in my whole life and this garbage's crappiest movies are nothing compare to this movie, the only one " star crystal" the best space movie ever!. am I the only person who found this movie boring? (I still think it is a great film)  I respect the fact it was made in 1977 and the acting was great, it's just every time I find myself watching it I get impatient for some reason. Maybe it's just me. It may be almost 40 years old but I still love this film!!! a masterpiece.so magnificent.still as brilliant as when,it came in the cinemas for the first time,cultmovieof the best kind. This film still enchants us, even after these many years..! I`m disappointed with the quality of the HD on the Close Encounters Blu Ray disc....the HD quality of film is grainy and looks dirty.....very poor conversion. DONT GO TO SLEEP:old film but the thing a.k.a ratty has a great resememblance to my ex husband and even eats like him lol ha ha Lost interest as i saw the CGI +MW Thunderclap "GEE THATS A GIGANTIC TUBA" IKR

Le Crabe-Tambour 	slt la soiree avec schoenderffer au poste 6 inoubliable MOTS K ART CN  MEMORY VAR  mon pere y ete dans les annees 70. il a fait 2 fois le tour du monde
Crash! 	everytime wacth this epic movie always make me melting... What World are you living in ???? you see what happens when you dont stay in yo lane lol now i have 600 movies in my computer but im sure this the best one i ever seen the actors the music the speeches its a masterpiece everytime i watch it i feel a good sadness when watching a scene with the best background music I JUST seen this movie last night! Thank God they didn't kill the little girl! I would have lost it. Seriously. This movie is amazingly put together. Excellent trailer, the music is Bird York "In the deep" - and in the beginning it sounds like the beginning of Puff daddy - Ill be missing youAnyway great job guys Neighbors Love this movie-Sandra Bullock is good in this-Doesn't play the all American girl like she usually does I remember going to see this opening weekend and there was only one other person in the theater with me. After this film starting getting Oscar buzz, the theater was packed for this film when I saw it with a friend a few weeks later. Hate "bandwagon" movie goers who only see movies once they are talked about in the media. I think this movie should be shown in high schools. A good movie. There are examples of human kind and a profound message ...... I like how a white dude directed and produced this movie and he showed how terrible white people are...I heard alot of white people did not like this movie. they hate seeing how bad they are I guess. tragic they don't even know lol I learned a lot of things from this movie I agree this is the best movie ever. In the history of mankind there won't be a movie like this ....salute to Paul Haggis !! classic .. it is a very very  good movie just watched this movie on Netflix and it was good ! btw it's about how we view things from our perspective . just watch it it's good !
The Crater Lake Monster 	good video :D
Curse of the Black Widow 	Wonder why there hasn't been a remake of this campy horror movie?
Damnation Alley 	Jackie earl haley moochie That moment you see Dabney Coleman and it turns out to be George Peppard with a mustache Jackie Earle Haley, the future Rorschach of WATCHMEN, as the kid! Nice. Good movie but the short stories could use a "Western" touch. Read the novel by Roger Zelazny. 10X better than the movie. Compare to the Saturday series called ARK 2 Need to be redone with more money and a better director ; ) A rare case when the book was better than the movie
Day of the Animals 	This reminds me of Frogs (1972). The poster has a guy's hand coming out of the frog's mouth. Hee hee...  looks like two 12 year old got their hands on the old man's video camera and shot a home movie.
Death Game 	That blue dress blonde is attractive. Soo this is knock knock? knock-Knock ???? Jesus Christ, these bitches are crazy. This is back when lesbians were fun to be around Eli Roth is remaking this with Keanu Reeves I think--that or he's flat out ripping it off Seymour Cassel! its the stupidest movie ever I never heard of this one before. I love the concept.
God Told Me To 	"You just don't love god the way I do." Holy ships. haha i swear that comment echoed in here Andy Kaufman Yayyyyyyyyy.
Desperate Living 	the dog part was disgusting.  i have yet to track down a copy on dvd. i have it on vhs, but no longer have a VCR. This is the only John Waters film I have yet to own on DVD
The Disappearance 	The movie is different from the trailer! There's more of Jessica than James. this movie leaves me speechless It's weird how I can relate to her! how to be single believe me that's the story just with another title UUUHHHHH so beautiful! Him, Her, Them. is her name inspired by The Beatles song? these movies are amazing, i watched him, her and them, mostly because i was really excited about watching mcavoy's acting. but please, please, if you are gonna watch them, dont forget to watch the other two because it will make more sense. this story is one of my favorites. I actually don't know how to react to this movie..but mehh James McAvoy's in it sooo, still good! :) And I thought Murph was busy solving the Quantum Gravity equations.... Man oh man she is stunning! can't wait for x men Apocalypse!!!! This US American Mega Hyper Individuality and Drama like People are so boring :pBut the Movie was awesome! This confuses my face a bit. James! Ugh the hell are you so sexy for?! there are two movies??? i dont understand, last night i watched but i only saw the part of the girl O.o donte get it its sad tht I thought this movie was based on beatles' song Will this movie have The Beatles song Eleanor rigby? So basically paper towns?
The Duellists 	a very underrated movie and maybe the best first movie directed ever. This is a Gem. A Ridley Scott Gem. wtf is this movie about?
The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town 	the Christmas one might've been better, cause I saw cavemen eat salty pickles cartblash? I was really stumped at that word when I first saw this! 46:17 - 46:37 Edward: "Not even so much as a thank you. Hmph!" Thomas: "If Chugs ever moved to Sodor and we told Sir Topham Hatt the story, he'd say Chugs is really useful. Just like us."James: "And splendid."Gordon: "And proud."Percy: "Yes, he would." I'M suprised chugs didn't have a Heart Attack! Heart Attack! I rewatch this every year. no was this the first special before Santa Claus Is Comin To Town or the second feature Kidville sounds like something that the Kids Next Door would do. I'll be coming here each year to watch this classic. From - Christian 4/16/17 USA I remember going to a neighbor's house to watch this when it first ran. They had a color TV in their finished basement. Luxury! I remember seeing this back on Fox Family, later then ABC Family and now Freeform! Easter 2017 anyone? HAPPY 20 YEARS OF 20 YEARS AND HAPPY 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF 20TH ANNIVERSARY AND HAPPY 40 YEARS AND HAPPY 40TH ANNIVERSARY THE EASTER BUNNY IS COMIN' TO TOWN! Sunny the Easter Bunny = Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, King Bruce = Jessica, Halelujah Jones = Topper, Gadzooks = Winter Warlock, Lily Longtooth = Burgermeister Meisterburger, The Kids of Kidville = The Kringles, Town = Sombertown Old specials are so cool. Check out my retro commercial videos. Nostalgia at it's finest. In the 70s, did kids really write to the Easter Bunny? Thank you for uploading this. When i was a child i lived for all Rankin/Bass cartoons, sitting here thinking about Easter when i was young.
Eleanor and Franklin 	When Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt where seeing each other before they were married Eleanor was doing volunteer work in a settlement house as a dance teacher in the Lower East Side of New York City. One day Franklin pick Eleanor up at the settlement house. She came out with a little girl from her dance class explaining she was not feeling well and that she was taking her home. Franklin Roosevelt took Eleanor and the little girl to the girl's tenement building where she lived. When they came to the little girl's apartment which had no running water, no heat, no cool air in the summer and no bathroom in the apartment but way in the hall. When Franklin saw these conditions where the little girl live he was shocked. When he walk Eleanor to the restaurant where they are going to dine he said. "People should not live like this." It's hard to think of two greater people in the 20th century than Eleanor and Franklin. Hermann and Alexander portrayed them so sympathetically. What a sad loss Edward Hermann. One of my favorites. RIP Edward Herrmann.  Rest in peace Edward Herrmann. RIP I want so much to watch the full movie, but I don't find nowhere! Oh lord, I think I'm going to cry again. The 70s produced so much tripe but an occasional gem and this series which I had nearly forgotten still shines. Thanks. well, she certainly had influence to the political circles franklin aspired to.  i think they were both from pretty screwed up backgrounds.  her parents were proof why there should be licenses to have children.  he was such a mama's boy.  i think they could have been happier together longer, if his mother had backed off earlier. Edward Herrmann was the perfect Franklin Roosevelt; so good that John Huston had him reprise the role for the movie version of "Annie".  He also narrated a History Channel documentary about FDR. It's been said that Eleanor was more of a catch - the niece of a sitting U.S. President (Theodore Roosevelt) - rather the other way around. Once, a person asked me if I was a 'Eleanor Roosevelt fan' or a 'Franklin Roosevelt fan' (not knowing there were, and still are, Eleanor and Franklin 'camps'). "I am a Roosevelt fan" came my answer. aaaaaaw! what's his reaction!? She was actually quite popular.  A number of young gentlemen found her attractive, brilliant, charming, and pursued her.  One, Howard Cary, felt obliged to write to her apologizing for putting her in an awkward position after learning he'd lost out to FDR. Thank you Jane Alexander and Edward Herrmann. :-D This was a lovely moment amongst lovely moments in this entire mini-series. Wow! I remember this! Loved it! How different would history have gone if she'd turned Franklin down I wonder?
Empire of the Ants 	Pure class. If I say so myself o boy Good times...When movies wasReally scary fantastic! Heh, giant radioactive ants imprisoning humans... Wells' story was nothing like that. They were just large swarms of normal-sized ants that invaded boats and houses. how damage I remember this scaring the shit outta me as a kid.  I was around maybe 8 years old and we were learning about dinosaurs in school and I thought giant ants would be like dinosaurs.  This film was on the television and my parents knew I was dying to watch it so they let me stay up late.  Five minutes into it and I ran into my room and hid under the covers crying in terror. No giant ants were harmed in the making of this film. 1:44 fucking hell,I thought my life was just poor CGI compared to that.
End of the World 	with us............. i  mean this is going to reality this is reality Deep Impact The Day After Tomorrow San Andreas 2012 Amradeggon the END of the world will happen on 3056 Fake Yup. im in  2017... this is a movie trailer Go and fuck yourself what is the name of a song it will never happen Who will save The Rock???

Equus 	Not a good movie, but a nude Jenny Agutter makes it worth watching. I didn't understand one second of this trailer.   therefore it prolly sucks. trying to be shocking has been done.Read the book and stop pretending. I think I saw a scene from a movie once that is somewhat related to Equus. The scene had a very attractive Brazilian young woman doing very dirrrty things with the horse's phallus. What were you stoned on if you don't mind me asking? i remember being really stoned in college and watching this at 4am One upmanship is tedious and unimaginative,unlike this idea and film Please have this movie and to me it is very important to pass really is for a good cause at my university please if someone has a big heart and has the movie contactece with me by a message on youtube thank you very much I have loved this film since high school in the early 90s... Harry Potter was so terrible in the play that I walked out during the intermission. This film is soo beautiful and amazing, with a great twist at the end! I just don't like it when he does blind the horses >.< What do you think all the pointless and very exploitative full frontal male nudity was for? I don't see the correlation between homosexuality and bestiality  Or homosexuals. This must be the favorite movie of people with horse fetishes.  And here's the problem with your position, illustrated by that little statement. One: it states clearly it is a TRANSFER from London's West End. Two You stated clearly that they DID NOT appear in London.Perhaps you should think a little before bloviating.

Exorcist 	II I see the exorcist movie very horror movie Linda Blair only did this pile of shit movie for a paycheck. Fortunately The Exorcist III made up for this garbage. Is this a horror movie or a docummentary about locusts? :)))) "Ratataaaaaaaaaa. Ratataaaaaaaaaaa" will i miss something if i skipped this movie because im planning to watch the exorcist III because i heard so many awful reviews about this movie. I watched this movie on Friday the 13th and I can say that this is worse then jaws 3 and the star wars holiday special Cocaine and discos were hellavuh drugs back in '76-'77. Exhibit A. LOl green pea soup They just spoiled the whole movie. LOL. I'll say this like I say it about everything that suffers the same kind of fate - the reason this movie did so poorly and WAS so bad, was because it lacked anything relatable to regular audience goers. The original was so good because Regan and Chris were just regular people in Western society - dealing with their own personal issues, when this gigantic thing happens. But in this movie everything is very disassociated from anything relatable. And it suffers because of it. Same reason why only season 1 of 24 was good - regular people couldn't relate to it after the "family" is destroyed at the end of the first season! Happens a lot, wish people would realise this. amazing trippy rocker music. absolutely out of control. I remember being terrified by this trailer when i saw it on a video cassette as a child. Shame that the movie itself was shit. Too many grasshoppers in the film cool theme music... like a sat morning cartoon..Boss!!!!
Fight for Your Life 	Holding a gun at a baby? What the hell? Talk about insecure..... This would never get remade In this day and age Hey it's the dude from Deadwood. this is a long ass trailer lol Awesome film. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. He knocked the guy out with a Bible. What? Classic line: "Who you calling a faggot, nigger?" Trailer makes the film look alot more serious than it really is. Dang. I remember this flick. There's a part on here where one of the characters calls someone a "deputy dog" and my mom would crack up all the time....weird how I remembered that. I have got to see this movie and soon. Thank you very much for posting this.
Final Chapter 	Guns N roses ya la vi I enjoy all the residents movie awesome trailer sucky movie sucked major ass... damn shame it ended like that.. Basically starting over The first movies were great, but the series has been going badly downhill. It was time to end it, but let's hope this last movie is a good one. music name? Another final chapter?)) yes she`s back Resident Evil movie is on my channel(6 ) that s like resedent evil 7 game I enjoyed the movie but what happened to Chris redfield he was my favorite in the resident evil series and I was expecting him to return in this movie shitty novie is one thing but man so many fckin cuts during fight scenes make it totally not watchable... best Resident evil movie ,non stop Action looks like a good movie When the movie premieres
First Love 	i loved this movie..watched it in my hostel..love from india *this movie made me cry like i have never cried before* ko g ada yg kumplit nya sih puta hanggang ngayon kinikilig parin ako gosh I am learning Thai but mai kao jai kha! :( tiene el nombre de una cancion de queen ajith thala photo super wow Um does this movie have a happy ending. I REALLY HATE SAD ENDING MOVIE I think year 2010? 2011? This movie was aired in ph for the first time and that was the time that I became the big fan of Mario <3 He became my thai crush when I was first year high school. And now, Its 2016 but still one of his fans who wishes to have an autograph <3 waiting for part 2 I adored this movie :) It gave me the same feels as the live action Kimi Ni Todoke movie. The story was so simple but I absolutely loved the innocence and purity of the romance. And this is the reason why I prefer watching Asian love stories over Western (or Westernized) "romantic" flicks. You don't need to show sex to make it meaningful or substantial see. mario maurer we've been waiting for 6 years please make a sequel of Crazy Little Thing Called Love. #MarioMaurer #BaifernPimchanokPlease hear our request alot of fans are anticipating for the sequel. can i get full movie with english subtitles ?? for download also Is that mario maurer

French Quarter 	If you disliked this video....go take a lap. Yeeerrrahhhowww!!!
The Gathering 	Just watched it not that good what is so weird about cornfields?
The Gauntlet 	Is The Gountlet the only Eastwood movie with a fight in a couch or bus at the end? I agree.  Sondra was his girlfriend, so he gave her the job.  I hope she was better at the OTHER job.  I assume she was until he dumped her for a much better woman. Sandra Locke can't act for shit
The Getting of Wisdom 	Most the cast were also in Prisoner !! Hilary Ryan is one of the most beautiful women in Australian cinema.
Ghosts That Still Walk 	Effectively creepy, even after I've laughed at the boulders... I was searching for this movie a few months ago but I did not know the title. I had seen it on TV when I was 11 it had quite an effect. Thanks for posting I ever I got a dollar for everytime someone would ask me "What's the name of the film where the boulders attack the elderly couple in a Winnebago?" I would be a millionaire. One of my favorite Creature Feature classics. Sadly, have a bad EP copy of this film. mathewboston :) my art teacher from the the past  . hes asweme! The Rocks That Still Walk! lol loved this trailer! - went on a internet hunt and found the vhs - james t flocker made some very interesting films that resonated with me - have a few vague memories of GTSW as well as The Alien Encounters which almost no one has seen  I saw this movie on TV when I was about 8 years old and I have been trying to find it ever since. Thanks for posting this. Whats with the cubed rocks rolling around? looks interesting, wonder why I've never heard of it before  holy crap that looks scary. where can i find this movie?? nice edit
The Girl in the Empty Grave 	What happened to the full movie? It was on here a month or so ago
The Goodbye Girl 	My aun was in this movie Quinn Cummings is one of those actors/actresses that you see pop up over and over in different roles and never really know his or her name. I always liked her but did not know her name until today. Didn't they make a remake of this? I've been trying to find the trailer for it but I'm not having any luck, haha. THIS IS QUINN CUMMINGS FROM THE GOODBYE GIRL Quinn Cummings sure looked like Liza Minnelli! I love how he looks at her after he kisses her. Cutest moment in the movie. He's just like I GOT YOU! :) The best reason to see this movie...Richard Dreyfuss & Quinn Cummings....love them! I love this movie. Richard Dreyfuss is a GREAT GREAT GREAT ACTOR. Quinn Cummings I want to see this movie!
Grand Theft Auto 	Hey Everyone, you guessed it -- this was our April Fools' joke for 2017. We like to give ourselves permission to dream and have some fun on this day. To those who were fooled, we hope you still enjoyed it, and for the many others who knew it was just a ruse, well thanks for checking it out! I thought this was real. I was about to say if ItsReal85 ain't directing or producing it, no thanks. If only this was real :( I wish it wasn't April fools That guy laying flat on the beach looks just like walter white in the first episode of Breaking Bad .. Damn I miss this show I wish this was real GTA is based upon TV series & movies, making a series based on GTA makes no sense. 0:47 graphics of gta 5 I saw this on snapchat. I think you guys left out that it was an April fool's joke. I was mortified. OMG =-O ! Grand theft auto V I wish that was real such q cruel April fools I actually was looking forward to this This would've been a good show I would watch it 24/7 damn ign had a whole channel set up and put on youtube just for one jokeedit: just realized that ign isnt a joke it's sad this is a joke. ALOT of people would love to see this!!!! Burn in hell. I've been excited for this up until now.
Greased Lightning 	not good  thanks This is part of a four-movie Richard Pryor collection with The Mack and a couple of comedy films, called 4 Film Favorites: Richard Pryor. where I can find this movie online better. No longer available on NetFlix. Ain't that a sum bitch? It's been 36 years since I've seen this movie. Where can I find the full movie this is awesome!! Cool stuff. Thanks for posting.BTW the trailer narration is by Michael Bell.

What is that song towards the end aaarooon<3 i cry so long everytime i watch this movie ~,;~ i love it I decided to watch a happy movie on lifetime and seen this movie called "The Greatest" and I read the info about it and it sounded sad but kind of happy so I thought it was going to be a happy movie and i CRIED so much during the movie!!! However i love that! The movie was excellent! I would watch it again!  probs hit his head then when he knocked out/fell asleep he went into a coma wtf i hate spoilers ooooh myyyy Godthis cast and this story, I can't!need to watch :') My baby died
Handle with Care 	I wish they actually make a movie out of this book...it would be perfect...I cried in the book my fav by far... so, how did it go? my mum spoiled the book for me
The Happy Hooker 	Goes to Washington So that's where Legally Blonde got its inspiration from.
Haunts 	kfiuyugggiijjiijj I'm just hear for Harrison haunt or porn? shark the ending is shit Bloody ugly post-grading, so typical of films now. sucked I enjoy teen romance movies, but I am absolutely frightened at most horror movies because they scare the crap out of most people who are faint-hearted like me. But when I stumbled upon this movie on Netflix, I had second thoughts because it looked pretty scary. I watched it last night and I was blown away. The ending had me freaking out though...when the movie was over, I just sat there with my mouth open and ten minutes later I was like, "Well that escalated quickly." Overall it was one of the best movies I've ever seen hands down. :) this movie was amazing, best movie I have ever watched in my entire life, the romance mixed with the horror is interesting so basically the movie has a lot of jump scares mixed between an OK plot and a cliffhanger. so if your looking for straight up goosebumps and flashes of freaky things. this is the movie for ya :) I recommend it but they ending is ridiculous:( There might be a part 2 The idiots who write in these comments down all horror movies. This was pretty good. You haters go rent gay pornos because it's probably the only thing you'll like. I want to see a horror movie where is gore like hell and just screams and no teen bullshit about a lovestory . I want blood. Why all hollywood movies showing nudity. we cannot watch them with parents. It looks good, but it's too cliche. any porn scenes? cuz I don't want my parent's thinking I'm watching porn or something.. Liana is so fine in this movie
Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo 	don knots lol Roy Kinnear gives great comic support. Okay but, if they were going to use Don Knotts instead of Buddy Hackett (the one who played as Tennessee Steinmetz), maybe they should have had Don Knott's name as Tennesse Steinmetz instead of Wheely Applegate.  Also, maybe Julie Sommars should have been named Michelle Lee instead of Diane Darcy having Dean Jones, Don Knotts, and Julie Sommars in Herbie together instead of Jule Sommars in a different car that Herbie fell in love with.   well what you have to understand here is that at the time this film was released is that disney oftenused the same actors as they were under contract for disney. just look at how many times disney used don knotts and tim conway in there films starting with the apple dumpling gang back in 1975 whereas buddy hacket and michlle lee probabley werent under contract at this time.so they used don knotts instead who was under contract along with dean jones. That's true, there were incorrect things.  I remember Tennessee Steinmetz was mentioned by his aunt Mrs. Steinmetz on "Herbie Rides Again" that he moved away to live with a Guru but, he should have been here on "Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo" since Wheely Applegate was an unknown person not related to Tennessee.  Regarding Carole Bennett, I guess she and Jim must have gotten a divorce without mentioning it here on the film which is why Jim was dating Diane Darcy at the end.   To bad they used every single money shot in the movie in this trailer. I hate it when movie trailers do that. :/ They have the Herbie collection at best buy for $10.00 - all 4 dvds Oh man, I 've seen this sooo many times when I was a kid. I'm sure we had the VHS lying around up until the day I got rid of my VCR. Now I'm having a nostalgic moment & I really want to see it again. *sigh* I love the newest iteration of the Beetle, and I'm even more excited to have read somewhere that Volkswagen is planning to release an R version of the Beetle. Some childhood memories & obsessions last a lifetime, I suppose. As I saw this movie there are some things I have wondered.  First I wonder why they had someone named Wheely Applegate on this movie instead of Tennessee Steinmetz from "The Love Bug" being with Jim Douglas since Tennessee and Jim were friends on "The Love Bug."  (Wheely Applegate wasn't on "The Love Bug and/or was never introduced).  The other thing I wonder is that, why was Jim Douglas dating Diane Darcy at the end of this movie when at the end of "The Love Bug", Jim married Carole Bennett?
Heroes 	2017 and still love this Zachary Quinto!! :o I must watch it where can i watch this? I'm only gonna watch this because zachary quinto is in it xD is this good? I miss this series!  :( I need to rewatch this masterpiece again. Heroes reborn is complete shit Schade das die anderen Staffeln nicht mehr so klasse waren wie die erste. That music is spine chilling nostalgia from 2006, feels like yesterday  Lol, this sound in the video at 1:15 :) I think i have to check out this series... To Be Continued..... Americans make shows to make us think all Americans are like 'heroes' seeking to save world from evil, etc., but we all know the truth This show went down hill after season 1, it's as if the writers got bored or something. After every season, nothing adds up . Gets really retarded  Looks good just read some coments and seen that people only like season 1 and 2 kinda made me sad , cuz i came across this video cuz i just finish wathcing the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and was looking for more (***SUPERNATURAL,HERO,CARTOON***) TV shows but my question is how did they get there well ... Superpowers? I think that is what people would call them most beautiful series i ever saw ...
Hi-Riders 	Lil Boone boy Lil Boone boy:-)
High Anxiety 	In my opinion, Mel Brooks never came up with anything as good or funny after this. I like his early films mostly (High Anxiety included) but his 80s and 90s work? One would have to be pretty desperate to like every one of his later movies. what a film, the bit when Harvey Korman is 30 seconds late and didnt get 'fruit cup' is the funniest bit of the film in my opinion "don't be so gauche. we're all doing it!"ahahahahahaha 1:00 Hey check it out! It's *Vince Vaughn*! j/k :P This movie is fantastic, as are most of Mel Brooks' films. I love most of the jokes in this film. Thank you for this.  God, why haven't you made a sequel to Madeline Kahn yet?! I watched most of mel brooks' movies but im not sure if i ended up watching this one or not. I'm only 25 my mom showed me this when I was like 8-9 loved it ever since just watched it last week on TV this and Hold That Ghost are my movie classics/favorites why not put the first trailer for x men apocalypsis?:( Hahahahahahaha
Hollywood High 	good job nate
The Hound of the Baskervilles 	i just now read this story. its nice] Such a solid story. me too and i love it end scared me just can't find this anywhere! the book is tricky as hell! The plot strays from the original here and there, but it's still very enjoyable. Plus, I'm a big fan of anything starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee (: the hounds of the baskervilles is the 3rd novel of Arhtur Co  Doyle TARKIN & DOOKU! There are many good versions of this tale on film, but for me this is the best movie version.  My opinion is of course highly effected by the presence of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and because I am of an age when these and the supporting actors/actresses were frequent friends on the tv and in film.  Perhaps quaint by todays techniques but richly coloured and rewarding. omigosh!<3 Dangit. English classes are doing it all wrong...these books need to be read for their own worth, not to fulfill some teacher's agenda i had like a couple days to read it and had to write a 4-6 page report Why the frown? It's an incredible book! because u r not the first to post a status like that here. 90% of u have your age on your profile and it'd doesn't add up ^.^ Shhh don't tell the YouTube men. (Also, y u stalk me? O_O) yet on your profile u r 21 :) so do i :( 1939 version is the best. Scarier and more atmospheric.  I wish our school wouldn't make us read drivel and get us to read the masterpiece that is the Hound of the Baskervilles. Or any other Sherlock Holmes book for that matter
The Hunted Lady 	those gorgeous legs. good plot..good intrigue and suspense..lovin it all the way.. the lady uniformed officer at the beginning really caught my eye....yes also donna mills was a beauty also back then...never seen this before ...seems like a good one ... I think every petite blonde female longed to emulate Donna Mills back then: she was beautiful.  And Geoffrey Lewis, father of Juliette, was such a memorable character actor.  I remember him clearly in an episode of Starsky & Hutch with Robert Loggia as a mafia henchman, a real bad ass, but then he could turn around and play an affable bumbling drunk alongside Robert Preston and the late Patty Duke and steal every scene in that show.  Vastly underrated. Cannot thank you enough again, Chris: kudos to every gem. A Quinn Martin production: always remember that narrated disclaimer before so many 70s shows.  Ah for those days; what a groovy blast to revisit them again.  I was 17 in 1977 and I just unearthed my senior class picture from the relics unpacking the other day: all wide-eyed innocence and long blonde hair parted down the middle.  Bell-bottoms too!  Wow. Quin Martin production. remember it well. thanks. Thanks for the upload..XD
I Never Promised You a Rose Garden 	By garage band, do you mean that as a website, or band? So lovely. Interesting take on it. i got it from garage band, im not exactly sure what the name of it is. im sorry, i wish i knew. what is this heartbreaking beautiful music in 2:50 ? thank you! :)
March or Die 	i hope someone will upload this one in youtube WOW!!  Terence hill in a serious movie! with Gene Hackman and Max von Sidow! Thank God for the French Foreign Legion still real Men to this day.  Movie made in Morocco march or die Wow, does people really pronounce Sydow that way? How awful! Great movie in deed! thank you for posting. I've been looking for the title of this movie for a loooong time.
In the Glitter Palace 	Tell me the truth, is this movie bad as they say? Lol, this movie was as bad as a lot of her music, so ONE-NOTE! haters, this movie was great. Yeah the acting may not be the best, but whatever she built herself up and gave herself opportunities, as for the glitter soundtrack, its a masterpiece. IMDB says this is the thirty-first worst rated movie ever, I came because I was curious This movie was terrible. Cheetah Girls 12 so its kinda like a movie about her life and career? this was rated 2/10. It is way overrated I have not seen the movie, but I've heard the soundtrack and no one can deny the soundtrack is underappreciated and in my opinion fantastic Wow, the "In a World" and a "One Woman" cliche about trailers was true Why the soundtrack is not available on Spotify? There were good aspects and bad aspects. The plot, direction and script were not good, but Mariah and some of the actors weren't bad. It's hard to act well of the script and direction aren't convincing. The set of the 80s wasn't convincing, and they should have stuck to her story more closely. Or made a documentary with actual footage. Is this the movie that Mariah Carey had a worst female actress oh my God I m not gonna lie but she not bad she just also good in acting they just don't agree that Mariah is a multi-talented person. This movie is good. It was an inspirational movie that has a good message. If u don't like it. It's okay. Normally, not all people have good taste and like rimming asses. Fck off motherfuckers. I think this is a fantastic movie, love it and grew up on it and is one of the reasons why I love Marian Carey (: A devilishly clever instrument of torture. 284 people are jealous that Mariah is multitalented. Love this move!!! Happy anniversary glitter 21.9.2001 Shane brought me here.
The Incredible Melting Man 	The First New Horror Creature.Well um, no. #MeltingCheeseTastic I really dug this one ! I don't care what anybody say. The bad NASA footage a side. The makeup was killer ! Its actually a good movie. its a grindhouse classic, and really terrifying. that guy looked like he already came all over his own face The guy who narrates the trailer is the best thing about it. Rick Baker did the makeup HAJKA! this movie is so bad its good Nice going MST3K! saw this as a kid in the early 80's. now it's so bad it's kinda funny How the hell can he be getting stronger if he's literally melting away? Makes no sense. Is this the sequel to "The Incredible Mars Bar Left in Someone's Pocket Too Long Man"? Saw BOTH!!!!!!!!!!!  I Loved them both!!!  I have The Incredible Melting man on VHS...  Watched Laserblast On Youtube recently. I remember taking my girlfriend at the time (1978) to see this movie at the Drive-in. I'll never forget that this played on a double feature with "Laserblast". Did anyone else see this at the Drive-in back in the day? There was a poster for this movie that was posted on a building in Boston I had to walk by a lot with my dad. I was five. It scared the shit out of me. I still remember what the poster looked like.  you can buy it online for $8 no
The Island of Dr. Moreau 	I like this trailer I figured I share it with my friend on Facebook this is more than a movie yeaah dats what im talkin bout
It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown 	Is patty voiced by a boy? Lucy sure knows how to charge my anger. Love the expressionist background of the dance Imagine if CB was your little brother. How would you comfort him after the experience he had on the football field? Is there an teenagers in peanuts?  because many of them are kids this taught me that snoopy can make a helicopter outta his ears i never knew snoopy was rayman ..............I thought ??? Charlie Brown had the hots for The Red Head girl ???.............. The way they treated Charlie Brown in this episode was really cruel. Lucy must die. -_- This has got to be the most genuinely irritating episode ever. Why Lucy?!?! You jumped the shark, Charlie Brown. BOY, whatever did CB drink from that, just idk, did someone put something in that drink, what was it?, LSD? Please Screen Junkies and CinemaSins, do the PEANUTS MOVIE, OR SOME THINGS LIKE THISPLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZPLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ddstsgdgdggxgdgtdghggcgdhfjhhhhhhyhghhhhhhhhj Hugh Hefner en ik heb geen probleem met de auto naar huis en dan is het met je verjaardag en een fijne dag vandaag niet meer in It wasn't Charlie Brown's fault that they lost the game. They lost because of stupid lucy. She keep on pulling that crap ball away and everyone still blames charlie brown for it. It was all lucy's fault!!! IT'S F#CKING COMMONSENSE!!! I've often heard that this was the worst thing to come from the Peanuts franchise.  And yeah, this was the first time Charlie's suffering was more painful than hilariously cruel.  Yes, Lucy, god forbid you give your home team a chance to win for once.  No, you have to mess with Charlie at every given opportunity, even when, as you said yourself, this game is too important for you to mess around.  And the way everyone, even Linus of all people, treats it like it's all Charlie's fault... I get Peanuts is meant to show how harsh life can be in a humorous way, but this was just unfair.  I actually kind of hated this.  Though what does save this from being the worst in my eyes is that Charlie did ultimately get his kiss at the end and didn't even screw it up.
Jabberwocky 	This showed too Much!!! lol. What an egregiously fucking useless trailer!?!?!?
Jian hua yan yu jiang   	I remember i saw this on T.V many years ago, and haven't seen it since
Joseph Andrews 	Simply ADORE Ann-Margret! She certainly has a lot of charms... Especially two in the front sector... ;-) plz upload full movie Shouldn't this be tagged 'Peter Firth in Joseph Andrews', too? (aka baby HarryPearce from Spooks.) It might bump up your view count from those of us who think *he*'s the totty. : ) To hell with the script I would have fucked her in front of the camera @nasher53  Do you know where i can find the full version of this movie ? i want subtitles for this movie I worked on this film, as did most of my mates in Bath. AM was very friendly, in spite of a lot of discomfort due to serious back injury.
Joyride 	A really good movie candy cane Holy shit this trailer literally shows the whole movie. Glad I've already seen it. who else is watching these old movie trailers for the trailer voice guy? Once again, they cut some scenes. And changed others. What's the point in putting them in the trailer, then? Don't hey know Something called "false advertising"? "caaaaandycaaane...." I thought Tobey Maguire was in this? Hands down my favorite paul walker movie very underrated i heard he had a lot of fun filming this movie to one of his favorites love the cast to miss movies like this This joyride to me is still the best! Plot twist...Steve and Paul are both armed, trucker gets shot. the end. This movie is the only truck driver movie I actually liked other than Steven Spielberg's 1971 movie Duel which was also about a hostile truck driver you don't see. R.I.P Paul Walker Saw this movie many times.   Who's older in the movie?  Older brother?   Steve or Paul?   I could never figure it out!   So, Paul plays as a younger brother or older brother?   Anyone? Why did you do it? Just for fun! We're sorry man Ohh i just having little fun with you man And I thought recent trailers spoiled everything. venna what a slut.hot AF tho oh how i love this movie. but the main Villian didn't die ;) Candy cane!!!!
Jubilee 	If you like this Jubilee, check out "Learning Hebrew (A Gothsploitation Movie) Both on DVD and Amazon Prime TV. Jarman was a pervert didnt he die of aids? I was living in worlds end chelsea during the punk hey day and it was garbage saw many of the punk bands many of them I was backstage and many of them where nihilistic psychopaths like sid vicious. Just rubbish  really . i saw that jonny rotten got bottled recently at a concert he is still churning out the same noise at least he took it like a man but his music is just terrible. I say all these things not that  i am any better than jarman or the bands just as a warning for any young person who is tempted to look at those days with rose tinted glasses and some ill placed romantic notion what is this song? Its a shame its not available on here, I remember seeing it back in the 80s and it made a huge impact Where can I find this movie? 1978?  I was just 9 years old then and I hadn't even heard of The Sex Pistols or The Clash, hell, The Ramones,  wasn't exactly a house hold name for us younger generations back then and Star Wars and pretty much Disco music and television  and hanging out at the neighborhood park was our past time in San Francisco.  The California radio stations seem to ban this punk rock type of music and this film might not have caught my attention because I just wouldn't quite understand what these older folks were about, couldn't relate to it. DEREK JARMAN - TWO PHENOMENAL COLLECTIONShttps://www.academia.edu/16168628/DEREK_JARMAN_-_TWO_PHENOMENAL_COLLECTIONSDISCUSSIONhttps://www.academia.edu/s/10cd914494Derek Jarman is leading us into a field that has to do with sadism, violence, torture, and many other perverse activities or attitudes or behaviors. The victims can be innocent, submissive or even a saint, the result is the same: the torturers, the sadists are enjoying their "game," and that means both the game they are playing and the game whose flesh, blood and sanity they are working on. Does this perversion enable us to better understand the constant resurgence of such acts both in peace and in war, both as a means to win a war or a plain means to dominate people and kill those who do not want to be dominated, but provided the perpetrator of that violence gets as much pleasure out of it as possible, at least proportional to the frustration they got from the victim who refused to humor them, obey them, accept their orders.Abstract:Derek Jarman - here only illustrated with pictures about San Sebastiane - is a brilliant film maker that deals with homosexuality all the time before it was called gay. He died of AIDS because he was of his time and considered promiscuity as a life style and multi-orientation as a must in this life style. Yet his films are not really dealing with this simple fact that concerns his own life. The films are most of the time using gay sexuality as a metaphor of segregation, apartheid, rejection, victimization, etc. That leads him to a vision of humanity as being an impulsive compulsive segregationist species.This is not so much pessimistic as realistic up to 1993 when he died with the enormous heritage of the two world wars and then all the colonial wars and particularly the Indochina war, the Algerian war and the Vietnam war, not to speak of Pol Pot, South Africa and the fall of the USSR. Has it changed since then with the Yugoslavian wars, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Al-Qaeda, and so many other conflicts and hundreds of thousands of dead people and casualties and millions of displaced, internally or not, people.If you take these films at this level then you find out that they are the most enlightening stories and visions of what the human species could be if they could develop their empathy instead of their hatred. But is it realistic to hope such a thing?Research Interests:Torture, Eroticism, Cinema, Martyrdom, Purity, Sadism, Canonization and sanctity, History of sanctity, Perversity, Extreme Violence, and Erotic Suffering Terrible film.odd but bit of a mess. Who is the bizarre man at the start of this trailer? I'd like to see more by him! Brilliance ................ Such a great film! 1977 yep, basically the whole film in under 3 minutes. Looks absolutely Bizarre, and therefore very interesting. Kinda like a combination of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Amadeus, and The Great Rock and Roll Swindle. This has footage not in the actual film......
Julia 	not that I would ever become a rapist but is it weird that these rape and revenge films to me not to be a rapist? Feminist crap movie nah think I'll pass up this one Sure beats Ashley getting being sewn ass-to-mouth! Does anyone know the name song that appears on the credits of this movie? Feel like this chick could play Anita Blake if they ever turned the books into a movie. I want to see this one "Julia" starring The Girl Who Ate Poop Another Girls against Boys ? feminazis wet dream ......- triggered :p very used plot but good performance typical revenge for rape with lots of graphic bloody penis-slicing/dicing...etc.  weak plot, senseless murdering of innocent guys and a very weak ending Everyoone dies because she kills them and she almost killes that guy she liked its like i spit on your grave So becoming a serial killer is justified because of the evil that was done to you? I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 3? Now they're just naming horror movies with female names
The Kentucky Fried Movie Prime Time 	is far funnier. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TOP TEN COMEDY FILMS The skinny guy at 1:53 was actually IN porno movies. Mega overrated. Still, it was 1977. This looks a lot like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Cuts the guy's head off; "Now take him to be tortured." you got the wrong year, its 1977 not 1997 So cliche, predictable, and so unfunny!!!!!!!!! Not even fair slapstick! TAKE HIM TO....DETROIT!!! If Filthy Frank was a movie that trailer wasn't even funny Who came here by nc pile of puss you will shit your pants.. Apparently I saw this movie before it existed 1977 not 1997 I haven't seen this movie before! The zinc oxide lady! Lol.
Killer of Sheep 	Did Moonlight remind anyone else of this? This is pure cinema at its best! Thank you Mos Def This is the most underrated film of all time,most people don't even know this exists and that's a true shame Thank you xo I think the reason why this film resonates is because it's about family but it's also about a man growing up in order to provide and sustain his family. Which is also what I feel "In The Family" is about, growing up or rising to the occasion in order to maintain your family. bitly.com / G  G Q o 0 V @DoctorWhoDom   hehe says a year ago under your comment well it looks like its back doing the rounds of film4 this year but 11.30 "You are NOT a child anymore . . . you SOON will be a gotdamn maaan." lol  Priceless Kendrick Lamar brought me here. @badlerify same shabazz palces brought me here @milefilms This film wasn't even "officially" released until 2007 because of the soundtrack!  Rights for the music weren't obtained until 2007 @ a cost of $150,000.  Consider that against the fact the movie was shot for $10,000, over weekends for a year from 1973-74, with additional filming in 75.  Some consider the movie a "lost classic".  You probably already know all this considering your comments about the broken records, etc.  I've yet to see more than this clip.  Now I want to see it all! This is doing the rounds on Film4 at the moment, including tonight at 11.10pm. The song on the trailer is SAD LOVER BLUES performed by Luis Russell. It was supposed to be in the original film during the dancing scene between Stan and his wife, but Charles literally broke the old record and couldn't find another copy. (This was the 1970s, remember...) Milestone used it for the trailer as a tribute. Interestingly, Russell's daughter Catherine did another version of it a few years back. @blink4691 Ah, that is really cool. I became aware of it because someone recommended it to me when the DVD was finally released. It really is a treasure. I don't think I've seen another film that was bursting with as much humanity as killer of Sheep. @blink4691 that;s incredible! I'm a Phd student and Burnett came to my school to get a lecture on black filmmaking two years ago that was AMAZING. I'm actually presenting a paper at a conference in DC on this film next  Friday! same here, always wanted to know what that image was on the estatic album. wait, so u never actaully saw the movie? it's considered a landmark in african american film.. is this a levis commercial? I can definitely see why this movie was named one of the top 25 movies in American film making history by the Library of Congress...very memorable. I cant believe this movie was made by an amateur movie maker in 1973
Killer on Board 	I love this movie and I would say its the best movie with Jason Statham I just here for yvonne The fact  Clive, Jason and maestro Robert... my #movienight This is my second favorite Jason statham movie behind blitz. "these guys make the navy seals look like a bunch of cupcakes" This was one of those movies that I did not want for to end.It was that good.. i know that actor hes playing in a movie where hes kind of locked in his care and travelling and shit The scene when Jason and Clive are fighting and Jason jumps outta the window and lands on a truck was crazy. Very good movie. I bought this on dvd. Nice cast of actors Jason Statham, Robert Deniro, Clive Owen. Jason's girlfriend is cute. I need to see this. Definitely my favorite trailer ever because it looks like every movie parody come to life. No plot whatsoever, just guys sitting around threatening each other, then "When Jason Statham gets here, everyone will die." Then everything blows up and there's karate kicks and a random woman making out with "Rock You Like A Hurricane" playing. 1:16. It's lie, they have never been in the water together)) The movie is definitely better than the trailer.  Much more serious This movie never lived up to it's potential, it could've been an great movie. It was still good, just nowhere near as good as it could've been Jason Statham is sooooooooooooo sexy... SARA WALKER!? good movie
Kingdom of the Spiders 	Looks like a movie just about killing hundreds of harmless tarantulas. i was gonna watch this till i saw the part where they ran over tarantulas to make this. those things can live decades--so fucked up you squash them for a fucking movie. hollywood just sucks ass well,that's one way to learn tap dancing. wtf!! I can barely even stand the sight of big spiders so this is one movie I'll NEVER watch.  I forced myself to watch the whole trailer OMG when Shat tells the girl to jump to him from the bed - check it out! that little girl was sitting on the bed with dozens of real tarantulas!  not CGI!  How did they convince her to sit there??? Those are just tarantulas. Most of them are harmless to humans. I live in Arizona (the movie was made in Arizona), and we have some big ass spiders here. it's the little ones like the brown recluse, wolf spiders, and black widows you need to worry about, and they are small. I've been envenomated by a Arizona brown spider (subspecies of a brown recluse) and I was a very sick person. This is what flamethrowers and hazmat suits are for. What a terrible and needless slaughter of tarantulas. They are fuzzy, cute, and absolutely harmless. When I lived in West Texas it was a highlight of late summer for them to come out and sunbathe on the roads and walkways. Why are people concerned about the life of spiders. It's like killing a roach or fly...I mean really!!!! Fucking Peta nuts!!! Now if this were a snuff film killing real humans. ....they would not care....guaranteed!  I hate all spiders.... my childhood trauma, thank you parents aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand another movie i will never be able to watch :D This was filmed at Camp Verde and some in Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. My husband was in the running scene when the water tower got hit, and that was the school he went all 12 years to in the background.. His sister helped catch tarantulas all over the valley for the movie, we have red ones, yellow, orange, here in the high desert.. Now that's a true horror film. Arachnophobia x10!!! Lol No CG. Lots of Spiders were harmed in the making of this movie just got done telling this story to someone else. I didn't know what movie it was but pretty sure it was this one now. I remember parts very clearly. soon as I see one, I'll know. Ma didn't make me watch it though
Kleinhoff Hotel 	42:00 she has such a nice bum
The Last Dinosaur 	awesome, love dinosaurs movies it reminds me of the Godzilla movies lol I'll take this over Jurassic World any day of the week! First we get the dinosaur. Then we get the money. Then we get the pow... Oops, wrong movie This movie made a big impression on me when I was an 8 yr old. I loved it! Gotta see it again soon. Why can they make fun of this movie on MST3K?!
The Last Remake of Beau Geste 	F'ing funny. I was a kid, watching late night TV. maybe nine. I have to revisit the movie now. wonder if it holds up on film as well as it does on my mind.
The Last Wave 	Richard was sexy in '77!!! I love me some Richard Chamberlain:) Just want to say to the guys at Umbrella. Thanks for being legends and thanks for keeping Australian film alive. If it weren't for guys like you and Madman I wouldn't be able to get ANY aussie classic films. Keep up the good work guys! MY LAND danger dola
Last of the Mohicans 	You stay alive! I will find you! Madeline Stowe was one fine piece of tail in this film. That does it, this proves my theory that Daniel gay Lewis is a chameleon. For Greatest Devil Jew Priest Brown American Lover Daniel Sta. Maria. natives should thank the white man, made you the most powerful nation in human history. You tell young Vallen, I'm going to paint Paradise Square with his blood. 2 coats. I'll FESTOON my bed chamber with his guts! Have any of you seen the Movie, I just saw it today for the first time. I was really sad about Cora's sister. SPOILER! O really liked that they kept Cora and Hawkeye together at the end. I was afraid that they would kill one of them in almost every scene Hail Brittannia! Fuck America give the Natives their land back and fuck off back to wherever you came from!!! I'm white but I agree we should have all been killed this land we call america does not belong to us it belongs to the native americans i can't found this movi I have always been curious about the period when we Americans pledged our allegiance to King and Country. awhh thats where tom cruise got his inspiration for M.I. 2 I've only seen the directors expanded version. So I bought the original cut region 2 DVD to see the real thing. That way I can have 2 versions in my own home. I've admired Sir Daniel since Lincoln and it grew stronger when he brought 3rd Oscar home and me not realizing he was a Brit. Amazing. It makes me want to grab scissors and chop off that hair. "Snip. Snip." (update April 2016): I've seen all 3 of the cuts and I chose the Theatrical cut as my final vote. stay alive! I will find you! so sad the indians didnt kill all white people umm is that white guy portraying a native america VICTORIA GREYSON?!!!! was the lead man supposed to be indian? because he looked like a white man to me.... how ignorant
The Late Show 	Why there aren't movies like that these days ?? It's all now about sex, drugs, F words - in movies and TV as well -  as if decency has become the enemy ! this film is nothing like this dumb trailer, its actually a great detective story This is a great film! Needs much more recognition! Winner of the most surprising perfect chemestry: Lily and Art. Excellent film with ditto cast. Great atmosphere with humor, excitement and suspense. Would like to see it again. Just find it! It's brilliant! Not that expensive on Amazon.com. I can't find this movie online. :( @storybellz Didn't see that one.  Hard to find.  But you must see NASHVILLE. @goback3spaces The only one out of the 3 you mention that I haven't seen is "Nashville" But, yes, I loved her in the other 2!! Esp.  "The Incredible Shrinking Woman" the story in that movie was Blah! But, Lily was so beautiful there that I loved it anyway...so mush so that  I count in among my favorite films. And, have you ever seen the 1978 "Moment by Moment"? People usually hate it, but not me! I found myself wishing I  were John Travolta in that movie, cause I wanted her to  hug &kiss me too! @storybellz Yeah, Lily was/is very cute.  You have, of course, seen NASHVILLE, as well as NINE TO FIVE and THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN?  They're required watching for Lily fans! @goback3spaces Yeah, she looks at least 30...but, her womanly (as opposed to girly) looks are part of what makes her so hot in my eyes! I'm glad she looks older! I just wish they would have raised the age of her character, so that the trailer didn't seem so nonsensical! But, I love Lily! She my fav!! I'm only in my 20s myself, but she was so hot back in those days, I would have married her!!!!! And, I'm a woman---lucky for me, she likes that in a person! ; )  I love you, Lily!! Yeah, good movie, but if she's under 30, I'm Audrey Hepburn. I just remembered and mentioned this movie, so I looked it up here.  Art Carney played a great "straight man."  Imagine that. I'll see that.
The Legend of Frank Woods 	it was good but the end was a little bad may be he survived by pushing him out of the way and holding on to the edge awsome vid
Little Ladies of the Night 	I remember 36:34 through 37:00 as well today as I did when this movie frist aired on tv. Pastor or not, I never saw CD the same after this movie. why so damm dark? can't see anything good movie I haven't seen this movie since I was 17 back in 2004 , it was a pretty good movie. too dark cant see the movie
A Little Night Music 	This production was an embarrassment.  This being my top ever for everything musical, the ONLY version that matters is the 90's Lincoln Center performance.  THAT is magical.  This is, to quote @eoselan7, "Budget basement production" This budget basement production proves that less is less. Look for the original, and see this beautiful show truly come to life. who is at 0:34? still upset there was no tour

The Magnificent Magical Magnet of Santa Mesa 	I mistakenly thought this was Tarantino's latest film. Still worth it, though. This has originally been a Japanese black&white movie from the late 50's (if'm not mistaken), directed by Akira Kurosawa, named "7 SAMURAI" about (obviously!) seven Samurai defending a little peasant's community. Then Hollywood made its own version of it in the 60-70's, with "cowboys & bandits"... and NOW Fouqa repeated the story again, adding some truly MAGNIFICENT effects, action scenes and (what I loved most in THIS version) - AMAZING, WONDERFUL LANDSCAPE SHOTS. I LOVE ALL THREE OF THEM! This is a story that never gets old - excellent job. PS. Thumb up & subbed. Have a nice everybody! ;) After seeing this movie I wanted to play Red Dead Redemption Nice movie. Thank you 1337x Awful if Patrick Wilson played a role in this movie, it would be amazing, he got the accent Where's the disabled retard cowboy? Spoiler Alert: 4 People Died out 71. Horne2. Faraday3. Goodnight4. BillyWHY HORNE NEED TO DIE training day gone back in time lol The Magnificent Seven VS The Fantastic Four, The Lucky One wins~ Does anyone know the names of the song used in the trailer all of them sounded awesome More like the Diverse Seven. Seriously guys, what was wrong with seven white gunslingers? I counted how many people died in this movie: 147 LOL I thought it said the again instead of the assian wich American accent they speak in this movie if any one knows please tell me Watched this last night !! 2 hours of my life i will never get back - it was ok !! Nothing amazing - some lovely camera shots id give it 5 out of 10 !! What the...CLEVEGE! ohhhhhhhh nice 1:18
Mansion of the Doomed 	I must see this very scary horror, frightening movie!
Mary White 	we're can I find this movie Does anyone know where I can watch this movie online with *English subtitles? This is stunning. I wish this film would become available to watch!! it looks fantastic! When I read the description I thought it said CamillA Rutherford, not Camille. Camilla Rutherford would have been way better! i do remember they made a movie in the 60's and they did a great job making it i was hoping they remake it! but this one is more dark and scary! can you recommend any great documentaries on her?? All I can find are documentaries on Elizabeth but I'm looking for something on JUST Mary. Reign got me curious on her true story :) Was Elizabeth queen of england and Mary's cousin? Well, It's a whole lot better than "Reign" on CW. Doesn't look like a hollywood make -- and thank god she speaks French (as Mary would have!) -- looks really good :)  when does this come out?
Mivtsa Yonatan 	pliss subtittle spanish Anyone who plays with Israel is a fool!!! Brilliant Movie! The best isreali ever made True patriots! True heroism.
The Monkey Hu$tle 	lemme guess a white guy made this movie my aunt on this movie Wow ... never heard of this one ... off the hinges!!! Absolute gem of a movie...Yaphett Kotto is the man! what's jive turkying? i never knew names were dead give away for race. so if someone isn't named denzel or darnell or something like that they white? Right on with the Right on!  looks better than dolemite Solid!  Right on Brown Horrrneeeetttt!  Mongo Slade from New York City, that's right... It is just a movie, do not take comedy as fact. "cheat, lie, rape, assault, disrespect women"the only rape in the film was one white guy who was raped by not a woman but a transexual,when were they disrespecting any fucking women or abusing children? also when were they fucking racist?? fucking mike tyson was premiered in the second movie....(especially toward Asians)i am fucking asian and when the fuck did they do that? you are just talking out of your asshole taking comedy as fact. There were so fine sisters in that movie .... I saw this movie and thought it was racist cut together footage 'till dude said get your monkey hustle on. With the music, and the opening scene I was like ORLY? Then the stole pork ribs left outside for who knows how long. SMH   Obvious most of te racist crap-for-brains posters haven't seen this.  This is a hilarious satire about floks having fun and surviving in a repressed Black urban neighborhood.  The social commentary runs all through the film but is sold as slapstick. So THE HANGOVER shows that all whites can do is cheat, lie, rape, assault, disrespect women (but celebrate prostitution), do drugs, abuse children, be racist (especially toward Asians), be violent, plus ever other foul vice known? Please... @notpip Odie hawkins was an author who was published by Holloway House publishing he had some really good books but not as good as Donald Goins who was also in the HH stable.  Okay, I notice that there's always some ethnic bullshit being said on this site for blaxploitation flicks.  "For Once In My Life" by Stevie Wonder was written by whites...so what???  But his version & voice made it a classic.  We are all supposed to ignore color, upbringing & trips and get together to make all types of people feel entertained.  If you wanna know a person, sit, chat, eat and fellowship with them.  that's what the producers and directors did....so STFU with that bullshit!!! I love how they bill Rudy Ray Moore in this movie as a big star--but he's only in it for literally 5 minutes.  Total let down. You'd be surprised at how many blaxploitation movies were written and directed by us white folk. 4 all u idiot Crackers who think this flick was written by the man...u wrong sucka!!! who u jiven???? southside 63rd street in woodlawn also.
Moonshine County Express 	Great car chase!
The Mouse and His Child 	Love the download good movie. I have not seen this in 35 years!!! This movie was fucked up. It emotionally scarred me as a 5 year old kid when I saw it at the movie theater in 1977. To this day, I can't watch it. Thank you for posting this!   Beautiful and terrifying as a child, especially the infinity and murder scenes, but great ending with powerful lessons. Absolutely charming! just finished it.  very nice film.  i'm interested in obscure animated movies from long ago. BONZO!!! This movie was way too deep for me to understand when I watched it as a kid, but I loved it anyway, because it felt like I was not being talked down to.  I could tell that there was a bunch of stuff in it that I didn't understand, but I just assumed there were real-life grown up issues being talked about and that I would understand when I got older and watched it again.  And I was totally fine with that.  A lot of other kids' movies fail to do this- they talk down to kids with simple, straightforward messages and don't encourage further speculation about the mysteries of life.  I think the sort of speculation that goes on with the characters in this movie, particularly like when the mouse child asks his father questions and the father doesn't know the answer, or says "maybe," it feels like it unites childhood with adulthood in the sense that when we grow up, there are still so many things we don't fully understand.  I've always thought that was really enriching for me. and then they got repaired and separated it's been a decade since it aired FINALLY! I've been searching for this for years This movie scared the SHIIIIIIIIT stray out of me its to bad I wasn't still wearing diapers like the little mouse was like ow ow ow and crying when the rat like smashed and killed them with a stone My teacher is reading this in class and I wanted some spoilers so bad.... OML the movie is way more terrifying than the book I never found it on video, but I did manage to get a copy of the Novel on Amazon. I hope Tom from Tom and Jerry  brutally  murders Manny the fucking rat after the shit he did brutally  murdering those two mouse toys I have been looking for this movie for over 25 years!! Saw it at the movies with my class!  Wow! Sooo, I came here because some person said this movie is creepy. Is it creepy? What's creepy about it? anyone think the rats represent black  people with the dating of the film the ska music, the worm charming and the borderline drug dealing Always thought it was rather touching how the Father was so honest with his son about not knowing something.
Mr. Billion 	Saw it when it came out. I always liked Valerie Perrine in anything. Fun enough for me. i cant get enough of that song "The Dukes of Hazzard" and "Billy Jack"? more like "The Fall Guy".
Nasty Habits 	EXPOSE THE JESUITS. Does anyone know where I could watch this movie? It even has a cameo of Jessica Savitch!
Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey 	IM A DONKEY?! How I recall first seeing this at Christmastime of 1978.That Memory is great. one of my all time favorites - narrated by my main man, Roger Miller During the program when the guy was there to donkeys if you look very carefully they used a "Jefferson"Nickel During the program when the guy was there to donkeys if you look very carefully they used a "Jefferson"Nickel During the program when the guy was there to donkeys if you look very carefully they used a "Jefferson"Nickel During the program when the guy was there to donkeys if you look very carefully they used a "Jefferson"Nickel During the program when the guy was there to donkeys if you look very carefully they used a "Jefferson"Nickel During the program when the guy was there to donkeys if you look very carefully they used a "Jefferson"Nickel <3 this donkey In reality, it was LaQuanda the big booty Donkey, who's big ass comforted Mary as she rode to the manger! This special was OK, but nothing special. In my opinion, I feel the North Pole parts feel kinda out of place. I <3 That Special!
New York, New York 	UNDERRATED FILM. Shame that De Niro didn't actually play the saxophone in this film. Instead, it was dubbed with someone else playing it. Underated Film...Better than La La Land I saw it opening night at the Cineramadome in Hollywood. People applauded and the excitement was palpable. It's so crazy people outside Metropolitan cities didn't see it Such a shame this isn't a better film. Liza is and has always been a powerhouse, but Martin Scorcese didn't know what he was doing with her or the genre he was trying to be ironic about. De Niro, as usual, is just being De Niro. The whole thing, the production, the budget, just seems like a waste to me. Whether it was trying to subvert the genre of musicals or not, it didn't subvert or artfully pay homage either. Cabaret did it better 5 years before. Saw this at the movies years ago. Forgot Scorsese made this! something tells me the movie The Artist got inspired by this.
Nurse Sherri 	The only way we can get this thing over with is to burn the body.
Oh, God! 	lmao. "well he thinks he's Goddddd." This movie looks really terrible 5 Bags of popcorn crap movie, turning man into god. glory be to the one and only creator, no partner has he made great movies George burns Mr. Feeny? Gregg Turkington (frequent guest on On Cinema) brought me here Glove and Boots! Thats not Morgan Freeman. Phoebe's mom is hawt MR. FEENY Glove & Boots bring me to the weirdest videos.... God being a white senile old man makes total sense. At 2:16 is that the voice of KITT? I'm just waiting for the inevitable flame war brought to you by Glove & Boots GLOVE AND BOOTS Old, white man = god? Politicians=god? Aha! I seen this advertise on tv the other day....thought I was hallucinating turns it's actually John Denver oh my goodness o.o turns out i wasn't going crazy -_-
Once Upon a Brothers Grimm 	This movie stirs up some long forgotten memories... Oh dean why did you die. You where a true angel from God. I hope and pray to raise my children to love and watch your wonderful work and admire you like i have . this came on  tv  the night before thanksgiving  1977 on cbs Blast from the past!!! Thank you!!! I always wonder if I was the only one who knew about this wonderful movie. Takes me right back to my childhood. Thanks for posting it. I have it on DVD but it's nice to be able to play it on my iPad. Clevon Little AND Terri Garr in the same movie?!?! I love knowing that Inga and the black guy from Blazing Saddles did this AND were in two of the best films of all time! It is SO nice to know that I'm not the only one out there that remembers this movie! <3 Thank you very, VERY much for posting this! Boss Hog!!!!! RIP Dean Jones YES! The curse is over...I can die happy!Also, I love the subtle references....like the water-scene from "Brother and Sister" and using "Dummling" as an insult. I remember watching this on the Disney Channel! :D thank you for finally uploading this! i remember watching this on recorded vhs. Thank you SO MUCH for putting this up!Now, if only someone would make an OUAT fanvid of the "Rumpelstiltskin" song...
The Other Side of Midnight 	I adore this movie I watched it when I was young and cannot find it anywhere who can tell me how to find such adorable movie I adore this movie I watched it when I was young and cannot find it anywhere who can tell me how to find such adorable movie WTF? The trailer totally gives away the surprise ending. Dick Gregory is the reason why i'm here :) love the book...love Sidney Sheldon...so I must watch movie also.. Great film! R.I.P Marie-France Pisier. What is the name of the villa in Greece in this film ? This movie was a great hit. I cannot forget it It's very telling: "Star Wars" created much of our present conditions in the sensibility of marketing/experiencing what makes a blockbuster, though the pure novelty and joy of its success has rarely if ever been matched (I remember there being something "fun" about it being such a phenomenon; its success was somehow anomalous). But the idea that a "soapy" historical romance could been seen in the 70s (or now) to potentially be a block buster is, today, totally alien to our sensibilities. It was not considered a success however it made 24 million and it only cost 9 million. It's not like it was a bomb. Its notoriety lies in the fact that 20th Century Fox was so sure "Star Wars" (10 million) was going to be a bomb that they "forced" theaters who wanted to book their "golden hope" ("Midnight") to agreed to book "Star Wars" as well. Oops.  you download it from torrent I watched this movie too many times. I wish to have the copy back. Someone borrowed from me but never return it back. THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT was actually a big hit for FOX back in the summer of 77.   This trailer is not good however.  Showing the fate of the main character??  Who okayed that?  Funny...............this movie was supposed to be the big summer block buster of 1977.Why most nobody ever herd of it was that some nickel and dine science fiction movie called Star Wars came out at the same time and bumped it from the theaters. I loved Marie-France Pisier.   R.I.P. Marie-France Pisier. watched in 1980s..... Fuckin awesome score. Never watched the movie.
Outlaw Blues 	Damn i forgot how hot Susan st. James was!
Outrageous! 	Wonderful movie... a true Canadian icon! thanks for posting :) i don't know how you got all that information from the trailer...
The Pack 	no attic??? The breed 2.0 "  failed director" wow, a movie with cartoon dogs and stupid Australians.  where can i get a ticket? The Breed instead of The Pack make part 2 please 2.5/10What horrible movie this was! There are 3 things that made this terrible to watch.1. It's too damn dark.2. A horrendous camera man that's on drugs i think.3. Slow pace. You can also make a movie too intense, so it becomes boring. this is a rip off of the movie Savage Harvest! mesmo depois de ver esse filme eu ainda amo cachorros konyollll ente bahlul plus how do you let your dog do this to you or any one for that matter if be kicking and punching that thing so hard I don't care what nobody says ever see cats do this crap nuuuuuuu cause they are lazy cute and too small wolf attacks .. not bad movie Can I just point out that what she said about wild wolves being scared of us more than we are of them is complete bullshit. As long as they are in a pack they will kill any and all humans they see if they need to feed, it's just the chances of them being closer to humans than other wild animals whenever they need to feed is so low that we don't get many people dying from them per year. Plus wolves like to stay away from human activity simply because so do their prey. The movie was dumb, but let's admit it, the scene where the dogs kill that guy who went to piss in the woods was awesome. I recently watched this and didn't she lock a wolf in a bedroom in house? How can it end without showing us what happens. lol supposedly smart dogs but when a human hide a few feet away the dogs cant detect it. lol.another one is. the lady hide under the car. wow. must be smart crew to think of that. who the f hide under a car from dogs. also, wouldnt it be a better idea to hide inside the house instead of going outside. just go inside a bedroom. close and lock the door. pull something heavy over to block the door. go to sleep and wake the next day niceand fresh. I would just climb into the ceiling/attic
Panic in Echo Park 	So she had a perfect black man that every black female wanted and she do him wrong??? Echo Park? Where are Dom and the gang? This looks as AWFUL as the music scene in Los Angeles these days A perfect portrayal of what's wrong with this neighborhood now, stupid privileged white people trying to turn yet another area into Westwood. This movie sucks because it's full of realistic typical assholes. Stay where you belong, on the westside; where life is nice and safe...and white. And why the fuck does everyone in american movies have a limey accent nowadays, this ain't fuckin' england, mate! (Echo Park, isn't a reality?) I been shot, stabbed, and have Echo Park tattooed across my chest. Oh, it's a reality; although, some may think it is lala land nowadays! Hipster love story.. ewwwwt She say she wants something that is her,  how is that different from the idea behind buying houses and marrying which is commonly associated with settling down. I watched this film. hit so hard in the gut. 2 things though; go easy on the music next time. AND Meryl streep's she looks ok, but not as hot as the movie is portraying her as. key thing is her lips. they are super thin and she's got two big lipped dudes hitting on her. lol I had to laugh because that was that wouldn't happen. Beautiful film. Hate the ending. The song ties into the end perfectly though. but eh. I wouldn't watch this again Anyone know where I can find this soundtrack? soundtrack anyone? or songs names?? Of course make a movie that romanticizes gentrification and the displacement of black and brown people. So hip, so RACIST! Can we please get a soundtrack. I fell in love with it. I just cant get the music out of my head This movie has very peaceful soundtracks Did Mamie's mummy fi ce this? Just watched it. It's a great slice of life movie. So.......... not the Michael Connelly serial killer thriller then? It's Tony, not Anthony. Isn't it?
The People That Time Forgot 	From the look of that cavegirl's cleavage it should be "The Tits That Time Forgot!" You watched it yet? Fuck this looks amazing. Will watch and report back.
Pete's Dragon 	i love that movie i'm watching it I would definitely consider this a live action remake but idk if anyone else does who is the old man telling the stories? It is surprising to see Robert Redford accept a part in a film like this. I guess he needs money for rent, too.Whoever wrote the script, fuck you. I know it's meant for children... But Elliot looks completely retarded, if not for its wings I wouldn't have guessed it a dragon. Okay it obviously cannot look like Smaug, but perhaps something along the lines of that blue dragon from Eragon. Asking a real question here, did the dragon dead? i'm not going to watch it if the dragon dead.. i just cried at the trailer My childhood in one movie, memories I've saw it I'm not giving away any spoilers though why do humans always stick their heads into other people's lives just because they live differently? if I was Pete Id choose to stay with Eliot and head north where no humans would disturb. Its sad when the boy is in the hostpital and his mother who died talked to him in his dream when he was a baby :'( i cried cause it will happen to me one day. Im crying right now because i thought of it. worst movie ever This is the niceeeist movie i ever see!!! I advise everybody to watch it :) https://twitter.com/1b17b07d42c4368f3/status/849079410019971073 Damn  it jim im a hunter not a zookeeper Must watch! i just watched this movie on Netflix and thought it was so good. It was such a beautiful film. I am just so impressed by Disney's new live action films. So far all excellent! This movie is now avaaaailablee too watccch heeere => https://twitter.com/3b5e1496d86e6e55a/status/849079410019971073 I'm bout to watch this on Netflix I actualy watched all the movie but its realy a sad movie I cried THE PEOPLE WHO SHOT ELLIOT DESERVE TO DIE!!! SHOOT THEM WITH A BAZOOKA!!! COMMIT SUICIDE!!
Peter Lundy and the Medicine 	Hat Stallion he is still good lookin and it has not been easy  good luck and happy birthday The clip was a promo for a 1978 repeat, but you are correct that the film was originally shown in November 1977. I own this on VHS; and it was '77. Not '78. Thank you, that is all. ok thank you :) i may just get the dvd cuz it may be alot cheaper and easier to find then a vhs player but idk lol..i just love this movie and i haven't seen it in years and ill do whatever it takes to watch it again :) Try eBay or Amazon.  Alternately try Craigslist or a local second-hand store; you could probably get a VHS player very inexpensively or perhaps even for free. do you know where i can find it? i have it on vhs but no vhs player lol.. domingo was a beautiful horse ;(r.i.p. old boy ;( @heine71  yes, it is Is the Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion made for TV movie available on DVD? The "NBC Monday Night at the Movies" V/O was Donald Rickles.  Can't say about the "Peter Lundy" promo, though.
A Piece of the Action 	I'm so sick of trailers that show too much of the movie and do so in such a haphazard way that it makes a great film look like shxx. Same thing just happened when I watched L.i.E trailer just now. For those of you making comments about Bill Cosby that doesn't pertain to these movies, shut the fuck up and find another forum to rant on. Love this movie my favorite movie free my nigga Cosby
The Possessed 	Everytime jeffey d m is in a movie someome dies .-. so thats were the gif came from ohhhhh I'd rather a movie about Jeffrey Dean Morgan doing shadow puppets. This was garbage. this movie is awesome the box actually exist in true life and is really evil plus when the movie was filmed 2 poeple died on set check it if u dont believe oohh thats why he became Negan Engel :''v ist beautiful :''v penis Negan a true story ??!??!?!?!?!?!? Back when Negan had a heart. wtf wtf this film is cursed I watched this when it came out and it's so crap I totally forgot it was Jeff Morgan in this movie Omg the story is true....Welp time to jump off*jumps of a tall building* he's useless without lucille. Negan :D Who else is here for negan Il prefetto di ferro addio al regista ARE YOU PROMOTING YOUR STAR ?RIK MARTINO E' TRA I MIGLIORI ATTORI DI TUTTI I TEMPI...GLENN A.

The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover 	Got to see that flick. Big Larry Cohen fan here, thank you for this trailer, never seen this one but I love his work so i'm sure its good. Anyone know where I can watch it or download it? I didn't know that there is a 1977 biopic of J EDGAR. I find the cast impressive. The reason why the CLINT EASTWOOD version focuses on Hoover's GAYNESS its because the SCREENWRITER DUSTIN LANCE BLACK is GAY! He was the screenwriter of "MILK" @storrs19  yes, Eastwood is usually first rate..  Find this movie/mini series it was very good too.. @irish89055 Clint Eastwood is making a move about J. Edgar Hoover?  I hadn't heard that but it sounds interesting.  I will look forward to it. great movie.... esp the ending scenes..  "he hurt a lot of people"  anyone??   too bad those scenes aren't on here yet... But there is hope since Eastwood is apparently making a Hoover movie..   oh,  885 views... guess i'm talkin to a wall.. Broderick Crawford plays Hoover perfectly.  This is an excellent movie that was on Encore a year or so ago when I dvr'd it.  After seeing it I can not think of Crawford without thinking of J. Edgar Hoover.  He plays the role that well.
Providence 	Soul mates are a term society has come up with to fill people's heads that there's a perfect guy or girl out their that's flawless. This is a lie. Twin flames are the ones that were created for you. Their not perfect, but you still love them anyway. I think people use soulmates for the twin flame definition but don't realize what their actually wanting is their twin flame This is kind of my life right now. I met this boy when I was 6. I remembered him as now I'm in year 9 he's at my school and his class is always nearby. It's like the universe is trying to bring us together but the only down side is he's 2 years older than me and I'm afraid to talk to me. He doesn't even remember me too i can't believe somebody was really paid to make this trailer & yet i still work at a grocery store Beautiful trailer, I will definitely watch the movie! Getting out of the friendzone movie ! I'm gay looks like shit if only .... um they are siblings then....? Oh look it's another romance movie about two heterosexual white people falling in love- oh no! But this time there's a tragedy. I can predict the plot already. No i would not wait This trailer sounds and has the feel of a book trailer...-_- So basically.. Love Rosie.. Only American What if each decision you made had a consequence? What if your soulmate was standing right behind you with a knife? What if you ate tuna fish sandwich that was three weeks old. What if you, what if you , what if you Oh sure, its romantic for a woman to stalk someone for 40 years, but a guy waits for a girl and its creepy.Don't you just love fantasy? thumbnail has me like Jacob is that you Bye. harry and sally but worse?
Rabid 	Thus film caused a bit of a rabies paranoia in the UK in the late 1970s I still remember thr posters warning at ports and airports Looks good
Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown 	my childhood right here Jack Skellington to the bullies and Brutus: HOW DARE YOU TREAT MY FRIENDS SO SHAMEFULLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you know those bullies are no good kids
Raggedy Ann & Andy 	I wonder what those kids are like now? Love this movie.  simply wonderful!  The songs were real gems too! You know what? This film will turn a good 40 Years Old this April. And my hero (Stephanie Sheh), was born 9 days after the film's release. 1977 is a great year. A fucking great year. Very cute movie trailer, I'll have to watch the movie sometime.  Love the kids being interviewed, they are very cute!!!!!!!!! oooooooooooo the movie is terrifying! I'll try watching this movie this Saturday. movie is oannabelle In a personal way, I didn't think this was a bad film. I also didn't think it was a great film either. I do praise the animation of the movie. Something I really liked a lot was that and that alone. The songs are ok, but they do go too far with them and get annoying. Especially the bland characters and confusing story really puts the nail in the coffin. And considering the fact that the film is too dark and creepy for children says a lot. But have a look at Watership Down, it does have bright and warm colours as well, but it goes onto a darker side. But, I respect Richard Williams' work, and do kinda like this, not as a favourite of anything, but just of curiosity. I could describe this movie as having a better viewing effect if you're high, like Heavy Metal and Alice in Wonderland. wait..is that BETHANEY FRANKEL from Real Housewives of NYC as a little girl at 1:04??? The critics were NOT "raving", too. 1:22 Shouldn't there be a sound effect there? ?_? "The plot was really, really good."Someone paid him to say that Before the trailer ends, I noticed one shot where Ann & Andy's faces looked lifeless. Why is that? Usually, Ann & Andy are always filled with so much life.
Raid on Entebbe 	I saw it and immediately said "Hey, that's HM!" Hehe that music doesn't sound very 1977. Good stuff though :)
Red Alert 	#EAmakeRA2remasterPls red alert 3 lost the meaning of COLD WAR!!!!! the only RTS that could express this feeling these days would be World in conflict or maybe Wargame.... Maybe this game deserves a remake Can u download that in iPad for free ? Pls replay to me thank you if you do so can I have 1 like? WOW! Effect !!!! 1:12 end of team mystic  Salutations,For likers of old RA, look into 8 bit series for old CNC formula. Why save dumb ass commie leave them dead Soviet has rised again! Grory to Soviet! Glory to Communist. Red Alert 3 was not a bad game _per se_, but it was bad for a C&C game. Buildings on water (aside from shipyards), amphibious combat units, automatised ore mines (why do you even need a vehicle for this?), Threat Meter and Top Secret Protocols etc: those were all innovative game mechanics, but they are not true to the Command & Conquer franchise. Such a game did not meet the expectations of us older C&C players, and it would have probably got better reception if it had not been trademarked _Command & Conquer Red Alert_. can you make red alert 4: the fourth reich this game is bullshit 2017 ra3 is a good game ,but i dont think it is balanced My empire Rising sun will rise again Definitely one of the best C&C games. I missed Command and Conquer. I'm still having hope that they make a new one soon. They cancelled Generals 2, but I hope they could bring back Red Alert again. Always a Good Game people. Anyone you know where inside the folders of Files are the original maps of the Game. Thanks. How the fuck did this game slip past me? #RedAlert4 still good!
Retrato de Teresa 	realmente son buenos actores cubanos y muy buena pelicula adolfo llaurado y deisy granados
Rollercoaster Faint Haunting Memory of Bottoms' Missing Eyes ... 	Precariously perched on the edge of the bed, frenziedly pulling on some well-worn sneakers, softly-tantalizing golden-hued streams of a June sun shimmering hazily through the bedroom window. A twelve-year old filmic mind is reeling, edgy with anticipation, as I readied myself to go "Solo" to a movie "Downtown" for the first time. A prepubescent "Event" of the highest order, the euphoric suspense of possibilities was virtually unbearable; the perfectly ideal pairing of 'Coasters and "SENSURROUND" promising an enticingly sonorous n' seismic spectacular like never before. Have never forgotten this idyllic n' cherished childhood film-going memory. Had the privilege n' pleasure to experience it on the "Big Screen" once again in re-release, disappointingly devoid of "Sensurround", in a (James Goldstone / Universal) Hard-Top Double-Bill with "Swashbuckler". Curiously, it appears that all existing prints are now strangely-shorn of Timothy's final, chilling close-up ... Which park was this filmed at?
Rolling Thunder 	I love the ending to this trailer you can just feel the tension. You know there gunna go fuck shit up lol Just watched it, what an awesome film. It's got the typical grindhouse feel, but it also some really tragic moments as Rane fails to adjust to civilian life, and towards the end the tension kicks up, leading to a badass finale. I discovered it from a list of Tarantino's favorite movies, and it lives up to his praise. Is that Morgan Freeman with the voice-over? Why haven't I seen this yet? "Let's go clean 'em up." You damn right! good trailer looks good Wow,typical great 1970's cast with James Best in a rare Badass role. Luke Askew,Tommy Lee Jones, William Devane. Don't make'm like this anymore! and that cat will be on my dinner plate tonight bitch wwe sucks big fat camel cocks how i did get there???? but its ok .... thats why i love it .... just like liveleak :-) same crazy shixxx Paul Schrader lets go clean them up Quentin Tarantino showed this classic movie along with a slew of 70's grind house classics at his grind house festival @ the new beverly cinema in L.A. some of the best were Blood-Spattered Bride, the Mack, the Van, Autopsy, Rolling Thunder, and Machine Gun McCain!! Here's the linkhttp://www.movieweb.com/quentin-tarantino-presents-the-los-angeles-grindhouse-festival-2007 Grindhouse at it's best.
Roseland 	Did u know the name of the song now ??? I GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS ! :D what's the background song?? illumunati lover... fuck beyonce & jay z !!! I GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS !!! DID YOU?? music please? what is the song of the trailer ? plz :))))) minha deuzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa name of music please in this video beyonce te amo LEGEND. i hope it be better then the other one i wanna be as successful as she is today... my dream @ImKillinEmx absoutely not. I was thinking the same thing. I swear I heard it before. Now I'm going to be typing trailer music on YT search box til I find it. I'm an amateur editor. I have the dvd :) @tyrachuck12 same here ;) <33 I want this dvd so badly!! This was emotional. THATS SO COOLLLLL!
Ruby 	where i can get the theme song im other site? because itunes don't work in my pchelp pls I've seen all of rwby and it's so amazing!!!!! love this so much Ruby Rose is badass we all know that 2 k disslikes are salem and all the grimm Not sure if I'm more disappointed or impressed that in an entire anime sequence featuring a cute red riding hood with techno-scythe fighting werewolves there's not one gusset shot.  But probably mostly disappointed... Ha! Wow, awesome and sick stuff. Thank you Monty for this amazing series and may you rest in peace I love how her eyes are way more silver in the trailer then in the show RWBY a great example for me of how wrong judging a book by its cover means cuz as of a few days ago i can pridefully say that i am a huge fan of this anime and to Sir Monty may u rest in peace you amazing person and i thank you for creating such a splendid work of art and for sharing it to the world and we'll make sure to spread its fanbase even further. Back to what i was saying i trully regret judging RWBY by how it looked through my eyes cuz i was ssssssssoooooooooo embarrassingly and excruciatingly wrong!!! and i am sorry to all the fans and my friends that i have judged. RWBY is one of the few animes that really made its mark on me (when i say few i meant roughly about 3-4 animes out of all that ive watched XD). The moment i saw the way the action flows in this show i immediatly fell in love with it and as i continued watchin each episode not only the action but aswell as the story dug deep within me it was such an amazing work of art and im confidently and extremely sure this anime will live one forever.Sorry for the long and dramatic story guys but i just had to share how i felt about this anime XD #LETS GO TEAM RWBY!!!!! wth have i been doing?? i late for 5 years lololol This is the first time  I ever seen this trailer, and at the end I was like "Holy sh** dude!" Don't mind me, Just re-hyping for series 5! R.I.P Monty Oum this is so badasses ded wellcome to crusader quest(?) I truly believe that if they had the actual amount of time they needed, Monty and the gang could have made Volume 1 look just like the trailers which I think would have kept a lot of viewers. Once you get past the first Volume the show becomes way better in terms of visuals and story. Now, 2017.. and I still watching this?
SST 	the song please it was an absolute refreshing experience to see Melissa take on a different role than her usual, dumbed down character roles. I put off watching this movie just because she was in it. I regret not seeing this sooner than today. I also laughed and cried so much at the end! Really, really great! One of a genre of movies, like Uncle Buck and Little Miss Sunshine, where the protagonist has a shitty car. amazing movie i love it the end teared me up xD My #1 Movie now. Oh my god, I love Jaeden Leibeher. Super excited for his new movie IT! Loving him in Broken Flowers, Lost In Translation, What About Bob, The Funeral Party, Groundhog Day, Quick Change ... hell, even Ghostbusters and Space Jam. He is just such a character actor. I need to see this as well.... It proves that young boys need MEN to show them what life is about... jaeden lieberher is always getting told to stay in the car omg Nice movie, I really like it. you may think I am lying but Bill Murray actually came TO MY SCHOOL!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!! Kind of like Ashby never heard of this movie,bought it today in 5.00 movie bin,had a good feeling about it glad i bought itvery good movie my cousin is in this movie i watched it because im bored.bUt i never expected this to be a great film :D I saw this last night - great movie.
Satan's Cheerleaders 	FULL MOVIE: http://grindhouse-theater.blogspot.com/2014/11/satans-cheerleaders-1977.html now that is  a     very frightening  group of cheerleaders
Saturday Night Fever 	The music was catchy and the dancing was fun but the story/movie was TERRIBLE!!!!!!  WAIST OF TIME!!!!!! So what exactly is this movie about a bunch of dancing at discos ? What's the point? Imagine the reaction people got when they watch the nudity, profanity, violence, racism and homophobia not seen in this trailer. that shit is gay Theatrical trailer as seen in the coming soon previews in your local theater. In the night fever, night feverwe know how to do it Looks good I saw this as a kid after watching Grease and HATED it. I didnt like the asshole characters BUT now being older and after living through this kinda stuff maybe ill check it out again after so many years....Music is admittedly pretty awesome lmao, then the snooty dance-chick found out her boyfriend was gay. Disco Sucks. When it went out and country came in during the 80s Travolta did Urban Cowboy, the exact same movie in a country western bar. It's so funky, I like it. 1:27 what the name of that music? One of the most underrated films ever. A really REALLY brilliant movie. The most awesome movie i ever have seen .. i just love love ... I loved Grease, but this trailer is very demotivating. No Travolta for me tonight another hyped travolta crap It's funny that this is the movie to popularize disco, considering how unglamourous Tony Manero's life is. jaj A while back, they were talking about remaking this movie with Jersey Shore's Michael "The Situation" Sorrentino. I hope that shit doesn't happen. GREAT movie! But it has to be the original R rated version, NOT the watered-down PG version they put out in '79. F--k PG! I really did NOT enjoyed the movie ... the soundtracks are great but the storyline was simple boring
Scott Joplin 	Scott Joplin will always be my favorite composer. Thanks for uploading! Where to watch?? :) uno de los mejores estilos musicales de este universo, una musica feliz, de la vida i found the link to watch :)http://www.alluc.to/movies/watch-scott-joplin-online/540848.html Coon music lol. and his marriage to Belle only lasted a few months, according to his friends testimony, she didnt care for his music very much, and they had little in common.  "The girl who loved him even more then his music"  - problem with the movie is it only shows his second wife Belle Hayden (sister to his student Scott Hayden, with whom he co-composed four rags). his first wife Frederica died a few weeks after marriage from pneumonia, and his 3rd wife Lottie (who preserved all of his unpublished music after his death, and championed his memory) isnt mentioned at all except for late in the movie when a friend tells Start "he's married again"  Such a pity that in Europe it's impossible to find this film on DVD. Even on Amazon it costs a fortune. :( Scott Joplin looks kind of like ELEW... I remember seeing this movie on TV when it came out. Originally it was a made for TV movie. Now Amazon was $20.00 to buy it, and You Tube wants $2.99 to watch it.It should be a PBS mini-series, so much story to tell.
The Sentinel 	Anyone else here from The Burbs?? "Did you ever see the movie The Sentinel, Mr Peterson???" amazing this is really humorous, as if they would pick rather aged person (M.Douglas) to be a field agent... just get a new president problem solved. amazing film. top 10. okay, spoilers.there is one thing i could never understand.kiefer's character thinks michael's character slept with his wife... why? as far as i can see it is never explained why he thinks this way. there is never any hint as to either his wife or his mentor/friend lying to him that would make him think this way.it just seems like a really random extra they added for more drama. Love this movie wish they made a part two.  loved this movie very fun and entertaining and loved eva on it I recommend it Badass movie nice movie Very good movie.. "they think you're an assassin...  they're going to kill you"Michael Douglas being himself  "Okay... time for a Quickie..?" cliche They should listen to Jack Bauer and theyll find the traitor in 24 hours. Jasmin Geljo kralj! :) Bog standard tripe. this is so familiar to the movie the negotiator, police man got betrayed and find ways to prove his innocence
The Serpent's Egg 	0:53Wait wait wait wait. Hold up. Dino De Laurentiis? -That- Dino De Laurentiis? Barbarella, King Kong, Co  the Barbarian, Flash Gordon, and Deathwish Dino de Laurentiis?...SOLD! Ingmar Bergman's SERPENT'S EGG is an important film about fascization of human soul. Every American should watch it to better workout what's going on in our country today.victor enyutin  Nothing  like  INGMAR  BERGMAN !
She Came to the Valley 	this is an awesome movie,I've seen it 3 times now.
Shock Waves 	the VHS cover is the best thing about the movie, I always saw at the corner store as a little kid when getting candy and it gave me the creeps. The best underwater nazi zombie film ever! Two things I did not understand :are those Nazis are already dead ?and why they die when someone remove the eye glasses ? Thats why Horror of Dracula was a success, Cushing hero, Lee villain. The only movie where Cushing is an o.k villain is "A New Hope". damn it directors, Peter Cushing is supposed to b a hero in all his movies. Some movies you make him to be a narrow minded person with an evil secret. I dont like it. Was expecting to see him as a hero and Lee always as the villain... its just better that way. Learn from Terence Fisher damn it. "the Faster you run, the faster you die" so if I go slower or not move either, i can survive? Saw a trailer for this in the early-mid 90's and could never remember what it was called. A few years ago I happened to catch this movie by chance on TV and I was like, "Hey, that's that movie whose name I could never remember!" They seem rather spry for zombies... I remember that flick...been looking 4 it... Nazi Zombies ! Love it!!!! As far as B movies go this one isn't actually that bad. The creepy synth score adds to spookiness . peter cushing = doctor who yeah, seems now a days, they have to put a rapper in every scary movie, totally fucked up please tell me peter cushing did this before star wars I saw this years ago when I was trippin'...scared the f*ck out of me! I thought ,'the beast must die' was Peter's worst movie... i could of been so wrong,lol. What an extreme horror trailer! Nazi + Zombies + Brooke Adams = Love! I was stunned the first time I saw this.. really great... and Brooke Adams back before she was defiled by Adrian Monk.... WoW!
Short Eyes 	The "claps"? I thought "the clap" was always just singular. @ 23:25 - A VERY YOUNG LUIS GUZMAN LOL but he told the Puerto Rican guy the truth.  he was a pedophile... Kill the ahole who slit Clark's throat if he was innocent. wonderful This really needs subtitles, especially when they're speaking Spanish. Good film though. I love the song playing during the credits. RIP Miguel Pinero. One of the greats. Sean Price brought me here. Just finished watching this movie. That is some acting. Wow! good movie but super gay bruh God's in Real life would get beat the fuck down for that offensive Does ANYONE know where I can get a PDF of the script? I'm in speech and debate, and I want to turn this into a dramatic interpretation, I'm 17, I love the realism of this movie. Please and thanks. PLEASE HELP ME... I AM LOOKING FOR ALL PRISON/MOVIES/DOCUMENTARIES/INTERVIEWS on YT and the NET. suggestions? I am pretty sure I have seen every fucking thing out there... it is incredibly rare for me to find something new been looking for years for this. Curtis  mayfield  makes  this joint  for me I've known of men that have done prison time for child molestation and wondered how they actually survived. I guess in reality they're just hated and that's it, but this poor bastard didn't survive two days in pre trial lockup! Supposedly if he was all macho and uneducated like they were instead of a clean cut nice guy, they would have left him alone. Funniest part, the innocent man is just another good citizen who only raped the children who never identified him. Maybe, doing the right thing really can be doing the wrong the thing. Anyone not willing to kill a child molester is either a devote Catholic who wishes their kid is picked by the next priest, or because you think Abraham is a heroic figure blessed by [a] god. Oh, & for the record, cops are child rapists' best line of defense, in the real world. They don't make movies like this anymore  . This is a true classic  . This was a great film! Thanx for the post!
Silver Bears 	@alanheath I take that back!!  It is on you tube!!!   Having just finished reading the Crash of '79, I was rather hoping I would find this film on you tube.

Slumber Party 	'57 OMG! This thing makes "HOTS" look like "The Forsythe Saga!" I want lesbian sounds like a 70's version of "Porky's" Cal the moonshiner is a ladies man already.
Smokey and the Bandit 	This movie helped put the dukes of hazzard on tv. 40 Years Ago, There was Stephanie Sheh, Star Wars, Surround Sound, REAL music, and amazing events. Smokey and the Bandit (A Universal Picture), is one of em. 40th Anniversary1977-2017 "Old Smokey's got them ears on, he's hot on your trail. He ain't gonna rest 'til your in jail. So you got to dodge 'em, you got to duck 'em, you got to keep that diesel truckin'. Just put that hammer down and give it hell." Anyone who has played "Driver: You Are The Wheelman" would know the crashing sound heard at 2:01 in the trailer here. Sadly, it ISN'T in the movie itself. However, here's a list of movies/TV Shows/Trailers I have actually found it in:1. Vanishing Point (1971)2. M*A*S*H (1972-1983)3. The Poseidon Adventure (1972)4. The Last American Hero (1973)5. The Seven-Ups (1973)6. 99 and 44/100% Dead (1974)(heard in trailer at least)7. The Towering Inferno (1974)8. Race With The Devil (1975)9. The French Connection II (1975)10. The Kansas City Massacre (1975)11. Cannonball (1976)12. Gator (1976)13. Silver Streak (1976)14. Smokey & the Bandit (1977)(heard in trailer but NOT the final film)(this film here)15. The Driver (1978)16. Hooper (1978)17. The Hunter (1980)(heard in trailer at least)18. Eyewitness (1981)(heard in trailer but NOT the final film)19. Mischief (1985)20. Maximum Overdrive (1986)(heard in trailer at least) A movie that was fun to watch (not real realistic) but fun. Given' the crap that was going on here in the states and around the world it gave us a chance to set back for an hour and laugh as silly as this film was IT MADE ME LAUGH! "Nobody, but nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice looks like a possum pecker!" Mark Elliott sounds surprisingly young while the does the voiceovers in this trailer; he still did a fantastic job, though! #1 movie of all time. I guarantee this movie will be remade. Bootleg BEer .... a great McGuffin ! Every Tom, Dick, & Harry who nuts in his pants for yhe Fast And The Furious series owes a bit of thanks to this movie that paved the way. Smokey I love you and I miss you Buford T. Justice thumbed this down... BEER, PANOCHA, RACE CARS No seatbelts in sight. Just what that represents of the idea of a world not wrapped up everywhere you goddamned look in more red tape and cotton wool works to frees my soul. Anyone ever noticed the camera mount on the T/A's roof at 0:35?! oO I dont know anything about this movie but thumbs up if tiggy of sons of anarchy brought you here. Hey look.. Fuck this movie alright? Shit is fucking weak in the knees. Can't believe Eric Forman and the homos actually loved this gay shit. Eastbound and ball sack hoe, crazy hoe! yeah!
Snowbeast 	snowbeast is eliminating human scum and takin' names ....I love it I absolutely love it and I thought the 1977 original was bad lol The depiction of megalodon in this movie is completely inaccurate as scientists have recently discovered these creatures actually had feathers. This movie changed my life. horrible movie, 1 of 10 gives it too much on the money idk why but i actually liked this movie Reminds me of a movie from the 70's looks Cool!! oh gosh looks this movie crappy.awful. It used to be a friendly creature before Luke chopped off it's father's right arm with a light saber on the planet Hoth. `people disappear without warning`WARNING: I'll be kidnapped on Sunday so I won't be answering any emails. Terrible  would you want a combination of man-in-suit and animatronics (with little use of CGI), or want an over-usage of CGI?  This film goes far beyond the boundaries of a rubbish film, man in a suit, poor acting, pathetic story. im not even kidding Not bad to be honest, i have seen worst This is fucking stupid. What a croc !
Sorcerer 	The editing on this trailer is unbelievable. So good!! What an incredible movie. Thank you for doing this, THANK YOU My dad showed me this trailer and I got hooked to the movie. I didn't get on why the movie was named Sorcerer, but he told me that "Sorcerer" was the name of a the truck with the teeth grille like from the old ford pickups. I am amazed how they made this movie. I really need watch it. EPIC AND AMAZING FILM! never seen the film but I would like to. however what did draw me to it was the soundtrack by tangerine dream. as I am in the middle of collecting all there albuns. terrific soundtrack I get the impression Mr. Friedkin likes automobiles.  Which is cool, so do I. Excellent!!! Friedkin's Masterpiece! The Trilogy complete! Too hard for the '!$+#$;# Movie show!!! finally in good quality :) but the trailer is only for people who seen the movie, and want to revisit ha ha...the soundtrack was later ripped off in the horrible bill cosby movie "ghost dad" in the taxi sequence Fantastic job. I did something similar to this with "From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga" (on my channel if your interested ;) ), so I know how much work goes into making something like this. From one editor to another: Great work. *Intense badassness.* Honestly, one of the most affecting and unrelenting movies I have ever seen. I saw it a year ad a half ago at MIFF (in Melbourne) and this movie has become one of my all time favourites. The only movie in recent memory to have me at the edge of seat and biting my fingernails. The acting, score and direction are near-flawless (a few things needed tweaking), but overall it's such a shame this movie did not get the credit it deserved when first released love that movie MASTERPIECE THE BEST OF ALL THE REMAKES..... (original movie 'WAGES OF FEAR', a French production circa 1954) Thanks for your post. Fuck, this trailer ha so much hype, I feel like watching this 1000 times in a row! Thanks for the upload!
The Spy Who Loved Me 	The title would be more correct if was "The Spy who phucked me" ! :-DIn the matter of fact he did that ! Well actualy almost all girls of 007 !:-D It's full of fun,Action ,James Bond  movies Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was in Roger Moore 007, movie. He must be Labour Party member !bonikingv 2:42 Your times running out globalist. This was probably the only one of Moore's Bond films where he was able to balance the more serious stuff with his own sense of humor. 1:21 Tony Robbins is in this film? 1:07 never thought Q would build a leaky submarineAnd amazed that they actually shot underwater, that's true bond, doing things for real! I had a die-cast toy of that Lotus Esprit when I was a kid. I loved that thing. The Roger Moore era of Bond films is  my least favorite - he added too much comedy - it's very much like the MCU era of Bond films with all the whackiness, slipping on ba a peels, etc.  Thank God for Timothy Dalton, Pierce Bros , Daniel Craig for putting things back on track. I always felt that they never did Anya justice at the end of the film, she started off as a perfect foil to Bond but sort of became a bit useless after Egypt. film starts -------------Caroline Munro appears *YESSS!*---------Caroline Munro dies *NOOO!*-------------film ends It's The Biggest! It's The Best! It's Bond... ...And Beyond! wow thanks. My favourite Bond film! Great villain, ultra hot Bond girl, beautiful cinematography of Egypt, possibly the best opening scene of all time! By far the best Bond movie ever, best song, best opening scene/stunt, best villain, Bond girl Classic film Nobody did it better than Roger Moore - the hero of my youth! They dont make 'em like that anymore :'( :) The entire movie plot in 3 mins. Why bother going to see it?
The Squeeze 	I an Peter first girlfriend peterpan has grown up??? :')) looks good about to watch it right now What is the song at 1:33 I thought it was called the sneeze Happy Gilmore reboot When you are french and you see that, you think "Squeezie" and you said "lol". OMG Peter pan still giving me butterflies. Lol just smile at me. I STILL BELIEVE IN FAIRIES!!! Gansta golf...... looks like a great production,Jeremy you rock bro. Bluesmeister13 Peter Pan high as fuck playing golf n shit is that Peter Pan...........................omg I'm watching this i thought you weren't suppose to grow up shooter mcgavin up to no good again. That close-up of the blonde woman with the straw hat and sunglasses is taken from Lolita. Please if anyone know the name of the song started in 1:26 ty Does anyone know the title of the song with the clapping sound? One of the worst movies ive watched..2/10 Is jeremy sumpter married to rachel hurt-wood?
Star Wars 	g IM JUST SO FUCKING EXITED!!!!!!!!! I hope to god there are more jedi left. No more jedi = no more jedi being seduced by the dark side? Star Wars: Maniqueism strike back. OH MY GODS SAVE ME looks like another big shit on the star wars franchise.(as if that hadn't happened already before) oh my goodness....... this is gonna be the bomb diggity! who else feels there just taking things from the old movie and making them different in the new movie.  Same plot line and everythin Great! Once feminists get rid of the patriarchal Jedi concept they can move onto Marvel and have an entirely female cast for Xwomen.  And a remake of superman where he gets killed by superwoman. And then Ramba, Rocka,  Forest Gampy. And finally a remake of The Passion where Jesus is well... you get the picture. I hope more book powers make an appearance;like how Yoda used Tutiminus in episode 3. StarWars Now directed by Micheal Bay May the 4th be with you!  :><: it's me Travis bernardini big fan of Star Wars The Last Jedi the new movie Why do ppl hate on TFA so effing much?! it wasn't a complete copy of A New Hope!  It had a few similarities, nothing more! I hope luke says the 1 quote to Rey."I am your Father"#DarthVaderQuotes came here from college humor What are the characters etched into the rock (that Rey slaps her hand upon) and what do they mean ?

Suspiria 	I will drink a few beers while watching this. Yuri Kuma Arashi by Sailor Moon director Kunihiko Ikuhara lead me here. If you want to know the feel for this movie, just picture old Disney cartoons on acid. With some gore. And crazy ass music. this film has some of the best cinematography of anything, a pure masterpiece , should be shown to all film students This movie does not look scary at all. How is this a "horror masterpiece"? That had my heart pumping. Amazing work dude I always thought that old movies couldn't scare me - until I watched Suspiria. God, that movie scared the crap out of me! most colourful horror film i ever seen , every set is like a work of art in itself From what i've seen, this film is in italian. Do they have a English voice over or something? excellent job. the only thing good bout this flick was the score. Suspiria Lobby Cards Complete Set! 8 Cards http://www.ebay.com/itm/182354123339?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649 Suspiria Lobby cards  http://www.ebay.com/itm/182354123339?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649 Great climax, without giving too much away! bueno pero no muere de verdad jajaja cage art is all i can say love it izledim filmi. bes para etmez. beyaaaz futbol :D
Tarantulas 	und das soll creepy sein Lilo and Stitch. Hello I actually spotted this on Lilo and Stich, spent years thinking it was nothing, but OMG it's real movie Leo G. Carroll was over a barrel. I wish I lived in the 50s. Just so I could enjoy old movies without the internet. *"Bullet's can't stop it! Dynamite can't kill it! Only Clint Eastwood in a cameo role as a fighter pilot can bomb the crap out of it!"* My cousin and I went to Orange, CA movie theater in 1955 and saw this. It was so good, we went back and watched it again the next day. Scared the crap out of us. We were 8 years old "To over come the tarantula curse. Simply quote a bible verse." This movie scarred the crap out of me. clint eastwood had a bit part he plays a jet plane ploit you can get the dvd this and them is the best b-movies there is Some trivia for you.  When he first arrived in Hollywood, and before he became the composer he did, Henry Mancini worked at Universal as a staff composer.  Some of the music in this film was composed by Mancini.  I remember reading an article on him and he contemplated doing an album of his best work from that time in his life.  I wish now he had. HAHA they called it an insect I watched this when I was 7 or 8. I loved spiders and had always wanted a tarantula as a pet. Since I had no fear of spiders, this movie didn't affect me at all. what a cute fluffy spidey Guys can i explain? why spider escaped from insolated desert laboratory to make him evil?  Wonder how many tarantulas they killed making this movie.
Telefon 	"Gosh! That Italian family at the next table sure is quiet!" Trump has already answered his telefon call
Terraces 	This movie is based on true events, the cop moved into a neighborhood with lots of Interracial couples, and he didnt like white person married to black person, its all about HATE and using his power as a cop to make their life  miserable. I have not watched the movie but have seen a documentary on this. Patrick Wilson is shirtless many times in this movie! Ain't this plot based on the crime show fear thy neighbours..? It's exactly the same storyline.. except that show was real i guess this is what it would be like if officer tenpenny was a real Person.. This is sorta like "the blackmans" version of Unlawful Entry. Underrated movie. It's a very carefully crafted drama and the characters are very deep and believable. The trailer tries to make it seem like an action movie, which it isn't. It's much better. S.L.Jackson acted like a big prick in this movie. Some great acting there. I was however eagerly anticipating this psycho nextdoor cop to posess a few more malign traits than brushing his chainsaw up against a metal fence and ultimately popping a few rounds in anger. Maybe something a bit more into the land of the perverted would soothe my needs. Just stick to your own fucken race. Boring, interracial crap fest. Just promoting miscegenation. I feel like I'm the only one who actually really loved this movie... officer tempenney What's the song at 1:22 I've been rewinding and rewinding non-stop to find out what it is EEEEden disliked this video!!! I'm sorry but Samuel L. Jackson is a *ucking *sshole in this movie!!!! Acting so hostile & racist towards an interracial couple, stirring up trouble, and acting all corrupt!Cool actor, did NOT like this movie! I was probably 13-15 when I first watched this and at the time I HATED this movie. In retrospect this movie is good. I live down the street and around the corner from a cop the I grew up with a friend who's his dad. He is the only cop I respect. If I get pulled over I hope it's him. Props to you Mr Bookman. No need to see the movie, trailer has already done the job Another fav by Kerry love this movie!!! yeah right... a cop living in that big ass nice house in California of all places? give me a break... cops live in studio apartments at best.
That's Carry On! 	They were definitely playing Badminton at the beginning not Tennis. This is Carry On Camping (1969) Classics :-) Well...

Thunder and Lightning 	Love David Carradine!
The Trial of Lee 	Harvey Oswald I wish he had made it to trial. There were seven shots. No way the TSBD shooter (Oswald or otherwise-probably otherwise) shot more than three of them. Here are his shots-#1. Hit Kennedy's back (probably his back brace), causing him to exclaim "I've been hit".#4. Hit Kennedy in the back of the head, causing his head to go slightly forward before shot #5 (from a different assassin from in front right) sent it "back and to the left". (This same assassin was also responsible for the nearly simultaneous #6 shot).#7 (3rd and last shot fired from TSBD) Missed the limo and caused the ricochet that hit bystander James Tague.That leaves #2 and #3, not fired from Oswald nor from near his vicinity. So, to round everything up-#2 was the throat shot and was delivered under cover of the pergola, lined up to perfectly coincide with Kennedy's emergence from behind the Stemmons sign..#3 was from the picket fence area and was intended to take out Connaly. His shooting was not an accident.Sorry kiddies, but sometimes the simple explanations are not always the right ones. There are bad boogie men in the world and they are not all lone gunmen. And yes. there are many evil and corrupt people in our government who don't care to do bad things to good people. There were seven shots.

And yes. there are many evil and corrupt people in our government who don't care to do bad things to good people. So if his wife had let him have his oats the night before the assassination, there wouldn't have been one. Still, she had her passport already I guess.And yes..Oswald did act alone although many groups he supported in his head, and who thought he was an idiot, were probably secretly pleased at JFK's  death.  And that is all there is to it...something so awful that surely one man can't be responsible !! Occam's Razor, my pedigree chums. They got it right when they asked the court stenographer to recreate the shooting in the sixth floor window. That's precisely what happened. Oswald started to fire then realized that other shots were coming from elsewhere. That's when he knew he had been set up. He panicked, went on the run and sealed his fate the minute he shot the police officer. The guy was, obviously, a raving nut case Ben Gazzara ,what's up w/ that mustache? in 1977,the networks were still afraid to show blood, 2 yrs. after the Z film was shown on TV. a ridiculous ending! is Oswald alive? or dead? still and all, a good work of mostly fiction .unfortunately, Oswald's funeral director swore he was visited by 2 feds w/ the rifle ,and they got a palm print off Oswald's corpse.that poses a problem for the story told here .thank you DVP. the FBI agent w/ the glasses looks like Oswald! balding w/ a big nose,but older. but the casting for Oswald was well done. Interesting alternative history a BIG WHAT IF? They were idiots in those days, three men have just handled the rifle, talk about contaminating evidence. The S**t train is about to leave!  All ABOARD! Doo-Doo! Doo-Doooooo...! It had to end that way! They got the sequence of shots wrong.  The first shot missed, 2nd one in the back/neck (as they passed the street sign), and then the fatal 3rd shot to the head.  Having said that, I must say this was a pretty damn entertaining movie and pretty on target with the characters! HUnter S Thompson wrote, ''the shittrain began 0n November 22, 1963.'' It has rolled along accumulating more and more shit along the way. It will derail soon. If Kennedy was shot from the back how come the back of his head was blown off, and not the front? they only care about the shots love this movie but certainly not the ending. I wish to thank you for posting this.  I never was it in the 70's. Oswald was guilty as sin. But I do think Oswald was wrongfully persecuted by the FBI for his beliefs before he murdered Kennedy and Tippit. I love America, but her government has a history of persecuting, harassing and mistreating our own citizens whose political opinions they don't like and continues to do so (and now they torture people after denying them trial or lawyer in GITMO). Is this acceptable in a democracy? Is this acceptable in a society founded on freedom of thought and speech? Can our society survive secret police monitoring of law-abiding people who question government policy? I think he was in the lunch room waiting for the call when someone else shot him on the sixth floor
The Turning Point 	Alot drama. wow, from this movie to "black swan", we've come a long way, baby... Acaba de salir en DVD. Compraada!!!! I met her today she was at my dance studio I love Lesley Brown in this movie. this came out on my birthday in 1977 You are right, Pointe! Lived this movie!!! Loved it! Miss my pointe shoes! The actual title of the film is 'The Turning Pointe', at least that is HOW it should be spelled and WAS spelled on the cinema marquees in Canada -- where I saw it five times at the age of five; just after I starting taking Ballet, Jazz, Tap, Contemporary, Character & Highland Fling lessons. I met Tom Skerritt in 2000, just after or during his divorce.  He was stunned & humbled by the fact I remembered, appreciated & loved his performance in that film...as well as 'A River Runs Through It'!  : ) I loved this movie so much but I cannot believe it is not on DVD in US format anymore, so all you can find now are used copies for $65 and up! this needs to be released again, especially after the success of Black Swan, would have been perfect timing.  I love this movie :) Am uploading it to my channel so you can watch it over there. Aaah... Baryshnikov <3  The Turning Point is still an entertaining piece of work and I watch it whenever it is on TV. Good dancing, costumes, music and art direction give it an extra push and the soap opera storyline make it interesting.  I got taught by Leslie Browne for an abt summer intensive audition :), she was so beautiful. Turning Point had a major impact on my life. Before I saw it I knew nothing about ballet. After I saw it I started seeing as much as I could. That was usually ABT on tour, but also sometimes others, such as Soviet-style Bolshoi, etc. This was in LA. Nowadays I travel regularly to NY for NYCB and to SF for SF Ballet. Probably 30 or 40 ballets a year. I've even seen ballet in Russia, Central Asia, Mongolia and Argentina. All because of Turning Point. great movie. caught it on cable the other night!
The Uncanny 	This needs a tongue in cheek remake..... The cat's come up with clever ways to kill....  call it Kittypocalypse .... more cute than scary to be honest No, no, no! Kitties am good! Told me they did. this looks awesome, reminds of the scene in Let the right one in of the cats, actually i go watch that now there little cats people. ...and capitalist, religious nuts and any right wing nut you can think of lol I wish this was released for purchase. Gumball: Alright, my fellow feline. Let's take care of those haters. THROBO FATALITY Sweet baby, no! The Zaibatsu sent me It's really hard to believe copyright nazi's are patrolling yt for this film. I know it was on here a couple of different times. They don't show these anymore and I doubt there is some huge market they stand to lose by them being on yt. The greed is astounding sometimes. Though I will say if a network were started on tv that played all these old TV movies of the week type films, I think it would be successful. So why not do it? i need a link pls i need to watch the full movie man I would pop one of them cats with my bee bee gun This used to be up.

Viva Knievel! 	Old guy alert: saw this in the Uxbridge, MA drive-in '77 America! Poor Ted Cassidy-all that he could get was a job doing voice-overs for crappy movies like this.
Welcome to L.A. 	Great movie. Someday, blu ray.... Yes... It appears to be the only option being it was never released on CD.  Maybe someone will get it and download it on YouTube. I can do nothing with vinyls, sadly. I used to have the film but I cannot remember where it is now. I believe it is at my parents' but not sure. You can get the entire recording on Amazon.Com but only in vinyl.  I just checked.  The movie is also available. I just looked and saw them..  If you do it would be great if you posted it.  No, these are the two songs sung by Eric Wood (played by Richard Baskin) along with this particular song. I know Heart Is a Lonely Hunter sounds like the Carson McCullers novel and then film by Robert Ellis Miller but it is totally different. It is an uptempo song... I absolutely love it! God Is.. is a ballad in the vein of titled soneg. God is the Greatest Temptation of Them All is that a book/film? Not the film, but the Richard Baskin's song from Welcome to LA. Heart is a Lonely Hunter is here:cinefamily I've been looking for God is the Greatest Temptation of Them All and especially Heart is a Lonely Hunter for more than ten years. Please, I would love a copy of the entire soundtrack . can you email me ? One of those space-displacing films I have ever seen. A gem. Wish this was re-released on DVD.  How can I get a copy? I'd also love to get a copy of the film. I've searched and no one seems to have it. I used to have the soundtrack on cassette.  You're welcome.  I'm looking forward to seeing this again for the first time in several decades :D I've got the soundtrack on vinyl (ancient) and I just bought the movie on DVD at Amazon for $20 about two minutes ago.  So it's still available.And someone is selling their old vinyl lp soundtrack for $6.77 right now if you're interested. Yes, I am looking too.  I owned the album years ago but don't have it now.  I would love to get my hands on it again. One of the best ever
The White Buffalo 	it's a Charles Bronson Seriously?Oh well, better than man-eating rabbits Wow, this movie looks crazy.
Wizards 	Who here agrees with me that this is a lot better than Wizards Of Waverly Place? take some acid or shrooms and sync this movie with pink Floyd's dark side of the moon album. what's the deal in this film about humanity rising from nuclear refuse If Mr. Bakshi ever does a sequel,  I hope he drops the rotoscoping and go full animation. Holy shit, getting stoned out of my mind and watching this is now on my bucket list When people say Rankin Bass' version of the Hobbit in the same year had weird and creepy designs XD what the fuck Acid Trip, The Movie. This movie came out when my dad was born. cool. my dad and i used to watch this movie when i was about 7 or 8 years old. i never realized how much influence drugs had on this movie but now, years later, and having experienced the sensations of LSD for myself i can say this is a pretty epic fuckin movie. This trailer is like an amalgamation of every cringe-worthy cliche of bad 70s marketing. At times it feels almost like a parody. Actually, it's kind of brilliant if you were to just see it as that. Vaughn Bode is the artist behind it..80's Graff artists used to use him as well.Great comic books..Great artist with some heady ideas.. reminds me of the Lord Of The Rings animated movie and Heavy Metal Mac Demarco brought me here This was really fun to watch! who narrated the trailer her voice is hot! I saw this crazy movie as a kid, it totally tripped me out. The artists were definitely dropping some serious acid when animating this film. Love this movie!!! wtf how have i not heard of this, this looks EPIC
Wombling Free 	It's Lord Fellamar in this movie! I saw this on the TV whenever it was broadcast in the UK. Nightmare fuel. Just to redress the balance, David Tomlinson actually lived till 2000, a good 23 years after the release of the film. My copy is in Beta.  I need to get it converted so I can watch at will. It's amazing we still have a movie industry after that sort of shite! ;-) 0:33. Good old David Tomlinson. You'll be happy to hear WOMBLING FREE finally has a U.S. DVD release through Scorpion Releasing. I don't think there's any special features though, but it does have a nice transfer. Well, the film did well in the Ukhere in the US is pretty much obscure as is The Wombles themselves unfortunately they got the guy who played mr banks in mary poppins. how was this not a hit? been looking for this every were remmbing watching xx and that's sad :( Yes. on UK TV. Saw this possibly in 1979. oh my i never knew bonnie langford was in this :O :-O i never knew! Um, Picking up litter is more tame compared to shoving "climate change" down our throats "Wombling free"? Picking up litter? Sounds like librul green commie propaganda to me! WHY ARE YOU HATES OUR VALUES?!? If the film WAS a Flop then Kenny Baker (one of the people whom played The Wombles in that film) wouldn't be R2D2 and Bonnie Langford wouldn't be a future female accomplice of The Doctor I was around in the 1970's and i never ever knew this film ever existed, ive not seen it on tv, nobody ever has mentioned it, so it was obviously a flop!
The World's Greatest Lover 	RIP Gene Wilder,you were great! Love the hilarious scenes whenever he gets upset he messes up his words and talks backwards. Are you trying to give me feart hairlure?
You Light Up My Life 	Makes me cry when I hear it, tears just stream down my face big time :( sencillamente grandioso This ugly bag Didi Conn didn't even SING this song in the movie.  Kasey Cisyk did. Any one who is not moved by this is odd syrupy schlock. Yuck. Beautiful well....really heart and soul n touching....seautiful melody..! Fantastic..... Melody really heart and soul and the wording  too!  Oh...this song came from moive  call you light up my life.....! I been watching this moive about 34years ago in Singapore with my girl friend. Well.... This song made me  feel touching ,so when ever I heard this I will recall back my passed  with her again and agains! Second time I watch in Vancouver  in 1992,but, still recall back with my same girl in 1979 or not the present  ones which watch together  in Vancouver !  Awesome, such a classic! You could tell she was lip syncing big time!! Di di will always be frenchie anyways Laurie(Dedi Cohn...nee Edith Berstein) got ripped off by Debbie Boone. She must not have had backers to produce this song for the Public airways. Seems like this was a slam dunk...take it right off the movie score...guess Pat Boone had the connections ...cannot blame him for backing his daughter but this so called religious person would have showed great class by letting Dedi record "her" song! Hammer Stimme und Herzergreifendes Lied, da geht meine Seele auf. :) Amazing Kvitka! Didi Conn cannot sing like that. Lip sync. Song track del film del mismo nombre YOU LIFE UP MY LIFE protagonizada en 1977 por Diddi Conn
The Rutles 	rubbish trailer for a great film not a trailer Saw this spring of '78 LOVES IT.... SO MUCH ! lmao this is such shit The bare-faced effrontery of Americans to try and grab everything for themselves is breath-taking. This wasn't made by the NBC or SNL but for Rutland Weekend Television a show made in Britain in 1977 by Eric Idle. I loved this movie! The pre-fab 4 were sort of legendary good.
Are You in the House Alone? 	OMG I REMEMBER THIS!I can remember some of these scenes from the book (which is the one I read first). XP Because she's not a VIRGIN?!!!!! If I could shoot ppl in this movie I can not thank you enough for posting this movie, saw it as a kid & couldn't remember the title. Thanks again. Dennis Quaid was a cutie What a ridiculous movie! The parents and teacher supporting a raped girl to go back to school and face her rapist every day! This lead character can't act. Pathetic. Tell them who raped you already!!  Love Blythe Danner though :D What a weird drama queen this girl is. She takes after her mom. I can't get over how beautiful Kathleen Beller was. Also 1:24 Alision is a Mega Bitch! She looks like Lourdes = Madonna's daughter. No I'm not in the house alone. Wish I was. Fucking bitch wife is in the other room. God I hate marriage. Can't wait for her to take off for the weekend so I can pound my 12 pack and chill out to shitty old movies. Guys please don't get married. All women are terrible. Worst mistake I ever made was getting married. And being heterosexual! the mom seems cold Kevin Cest i was thinking the same thing So this is about a rapist? It's also on NF right now. Thet pervy teacher looks like chris stirewalt from Fox news lol good movie. i love finding all these old movies on here thanks for posting Her mother's mentality annoys my soul 5:16 Gwyneth Paltrow's mom
The Bad News Bears Go to Japan 	Yeah, these ringers took the magic away from the game and the Bears. From what I remember, the game was called because of rain. What was the score when it was called.
Barracuda 	This recently aired in England and I'm obsessed oh is it base on michael kim's life story? why is this a mini series and not a full series?? the book has like 500 pages. im sure they left out alot. Amazing show! It's very unfair you can only watch it in Australia ): when is episode 5? love this show! reading the book... looking forward to the series! Cannot wait for this.
The Bastard 	say please tea song of the series beginning one chants the name of the song or the singer Is this a good show ? I loved Sons of Anarchy Anti Christian propaganda, shame on Ed Sheeran good show .. You have to love the selective memory of some of the people posting on this trailer. 1 token black guy shows up in a medieval flick and everyone loses their mind. But when a white guy is the ultimate ninja or samurai in Asia or the king of the jungle in Africa and all you can hear is crickets. Dont rely on the Trailer so much..! If someone ever liked Game of Thrones and Vikings and True Blood.. they will definitely love this one. It is bloody and mysterious like GOT. Has some historic elements and authentic swordplay like The Vikings and Clever and ruthless Bill Compton in it like the True Blood.  It also has a bit of magic a nice queen, a bad ass bastard executioner and a witch and a Templar too they seem to be friends.. hope i didn't spoil too much  :) sad dat it isn't going to be developed.. :( Pity they cancelled the show just after one season. I found the story interesting and there was definitely some potential in developing it further. Why the hell are there so many shitty TV series that basically run like forever but the good ones often get cancelled?! everything I enjoy gets cancelled... This show is garbage. i like it very much so far.the acting of Flora Spencer-Longhurst as baroness love is absolutely amazing and exceptional.Great actress hope we see more of her Show was BAF good riddance. reception for this is bad on reviewer websites, came here and it seems comments/reception is bad as well... guess i'd bail The Bastard Enunciators! Remember when actors articulated clearly so's to be understood? THE BASTARD thank goodness this boring ass show got cancelled. Yeaaaaaaaaaaa Not surprised this has been canned So is this soa with horses? I've watched first two episodes. This show sucks in every possible way. Every twist of the plot is so bloody obvious. The acting is horrible. So are the characters, camera work and every other thing that can make a difference. Avoid it. is this any good? Chris Hemsworth could've been great for this role... I'm just saying, if they decide to take it to Hollywood, that is...   ;-)
Battered Wow! 	I love it. So intense.
The Bees 	Y O U  L I K E  J A Z Z ? she dumped a man for a beea bee Hate bees, but good movie. Don't worry about that honey little bee (Barry) considering most of American honey is syrup. Y A  L I K E  J A Z Z WTF! at 1:01 thats not barry thats the testing bee also named barry plus he fat bruh how does dreamwork mess up their own damn trailer!?!?!??! I've never been so scared to scroll down the comments does he even realise that if he stings anyone he will die? privelaged white woman beats Mexican male 0:38 police called and Mexican has been arrested. art 1:00 if Barry stung that person Barry would be committing suicide because when bees sting people they die YOU LIKE JAHAZZZZZZXZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzsgyjasdzx c U  KLL EKIIK   JAAZZZZZZZ My favorite movie quote "ya like jazz" better then Maya the bee movie Maya the bee movie is worse of the worse The Bee Movie but its normal *Ya like jazz?* 0:19 Those ain't no winter boots, nibba those are timbs. ya like jazz You like jazz?! Yee
The Bermuda Depths 	Eye of the turtle Apollo...eye of the turtle. The facebook page yay-> https://www.facebook.com/groups/BermudaDepths/ I guess so, I know that baby turtles chirp. ILL HAVE NIGHTMARES OF GIANT TURTLES YET AGAIN Carl Weathers is fucking sexy in a Speedo.  Why did the fake giant turtle sounds like a whale Giant anime eyed Turtles, sweeeeeeeeet. Overacting and bad special effects scared the devil out of me as a kid. Thank You for the clips!
The Bermuda Triangle 	2012 , jurney to the center of the earth and another else guys? it's so fucking fake that is only for inter10ment... this was just a bunch of movies and youtube videos striped together, plus it did the hunger games whitsleing thing, OF COURSE ITS FAKE @Jeff Torsorio I just noticed that it was journey 2 COPYRIGHT!!!!! I think? Fake wr is this movie ? i couldnt found ? FAKE the film don't exist. This is a video editing from various video from youtube using Magix Video de Luxe. Is it a cute kid prankster.... HELP, CANT FIND THE FILM..... cant find the film, help....
The Betsy 	Yes, I recall this movie. I do not know how graphic in description the novel is or if the novel includes such strange sex scenes by the senior. He ends up doing the maid, his daughter in law, and a school teacher for crying out loud. Junior is so upset at finding his wife in bed with his father that he kills himself moments later. Was Mr. Ford ever so immoral and ruthless as the founder of Bethlehem Motors? Tommy Lee Jones such a handsome! I just fall in love)) Best line in this movie was by the industrial spy... "Information is like sex; if you tell where you get it you won't get it anymore." Have the soundtrack now. Pleased to bits. Shot at the American Motors plant in Kenosha in late 1977. Those are new 1978 AMC Concords on the assembly line. I love this movie, but this isn't the section I would post here on YouTube. Rather boring. This was a good mini series.  Also wish I could find Janes Michener's Space mini series. Harold Robbins wrote a book maybe in the 80 and they was a TV series too. The story was about a German immigrant baker married to a American woman. he had 2 sons one was not successful and always in trouble and the other became a us senator.  Nonsense! Glittery trash done as well as possible. And Olivier was stupendous! a truly terrible film   all the actors are showing up to avoid having to go to the unemployment line.  Lesley anne about the only exception.  Early bad Jones, one good scene near the end by Duvall   and that's it.  It might as well have ended with the warner brothers sound and dd dd dd dats all folks.  Odd that Jones and Devall would later team with devastating force in Lonesome Dove.  Which was actually more their metier.  And Olivier, Jesus, my god, heavens to betsy, holy Christ, what a joke. Tommy Lee Jones is such a hunk in The Betsy - reminds me of an old boyfriend.  Crazy movie. OMG, Look at Tommy Lee Jones, so young.  And those frumpy clothes on Kathleen Beller hid a killer body! (Go watch the pool nude scene). And Lesley Anne-Down and Jane Alexander look very respectable dressed up.  And all those stars!  And my home, San Francisco.  With all that talent, and one of the "better" Harold Robbins novels, you would think this movie wouldn't be such CRAP! Is this on DVD yet? ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. my favorite book AND The Movie gave it so much justice  @penelopeat8pm i seconded that pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beyond and Back 	I know a retired doctor who told me that when he was a young intern he was given the graveyard shift at a hospital and was the only doctor on his floor. An old terminally ill man coded (died) early in the morning when the sun was just rising. They brought in the equipment to try to resuscitate him but couldn't. When he was alone with the body standing at the foot of the bed filling out the chart, door shut, curtains drawn, about 15 minutes later, the room suddenly filled with a bright blue/white fog that make its own light. He stood there in silence, not moving, just looking. Then he saw human figures moving around in the fog in total silence. It lasted about 30 seconds to a minute. Then it all vanished.He kept quiet about what he saw for many years. Eventually he told two other doctors, one of which I also knew, and they both told him that they knew what he saw because they had seen the same thing. I saw this movie at the theater with two friends, Dan and Doug, Didn't seem to scare Doug at all during the hell scenes. I remember looking at him and he was just watching. Doug passed away Jan 2017, he was 53, I wonder what Doug is doing in Heaven? So I carry the seeds of my love long before that. I became aware back when I was 14 years old in the autumn of 1961 It was the late 80's or Early 90's & I fell in love. I was in my 30's then. The original birth of Raymond Moody's movie scrips ty for download I can't believe you found this movie! I saw this as a child when it was originally showing in theaters and I never forgot about it.I just searched it on YouTube not thinking I would actually find it. Thanks for posting this! I saw this movie in a theater when it first came out. There was a short movie following it that haunted me and I am desperately searching for it. It contained 4 scenes... one being a gentleman picking up a girl hitch hiking and taking her to her home just to be told she had died previously... in the car where she sat was a bouquet of flowers. I am hoping someone searches this movie out and can direct me to finding the second part. I was a kid and it was scary...I am guessing now it would be a laugh...but still. i used to have the badass poster for this movie, but never saw it!! thanks! i can leave the body almost at will theirs a tingling or high pitched humming before the soul comes out. you are your self when comming out. like undressing a robe and looking at the the robe you  through on the ground. I hope there is beer on the other side ... thanks for posting this, I heard about it on COAST TO COAST AM and thought I'd watch it... really cool, thanks again Good movie. You are invited to visit this website:www.cristoluzdelmundo.com I absolutely agree with the reincarnation part. It explains so much more about life than if we don't believe. i saw this movie In the late 70s in theatres when it was released I seen this movie as a child with my mom who has also passed the devil wants you to believe that everyone goes to heaven and that is not true, you have to accept Jesus as your savior I never forget this movie when I first saw it as 12-year old boy with my mother. It reinforced what I already believed about the hereafter. My mom has since gone to be with the Lord so seeing this movie again after all these years is especially tender. I spent many years since then trying to find or purchase this movie but to no avail. What a pleasant surprise it was to find this movie here and relive cherished moments I shared with her. Thank you for sharing it and now I look forward to sharing it with my 12-year old daughter. But somehow I dont think she is going to appreciate it as much as I did.  lol I saw this movie in a theater when I was a kid. I could never find this on video.
The Big Fix 	At 01:42 is that Allison Parker's father? You remember, the news reporter that was shot on live TV. WDBJ7. So Omar Mateen was in this documentary?  This is more scary than i thought. I am guessing that he is involve in more incidents .You are very ignorant. The fact that you are NOT driving on oil solves a bunch of issues. I watched this and so did the NSA.  I didn't mean like you or I my friend, I meant the dudes that are supposed to be speaking for you and I in Government. It will be the people like you and I that will change things, I hope :) But we have the brains and the know how to come up with a system that is NOT Corrupt... and is for the people, by the people!   I had to load this video like 10 times before it completed... conspiracy! jk capitalism and democracy are awesome and could be awesome if that was what we had.  Hyper capitalism and a refusal to prosecute conflicts of interest have corrupted the system to where very bad things are heading our way if we cannot get it corrected.  Soon! Save yourself and your family don't eat Gulf seafood! I live on the Gulf Coast and grew up eating seafood my whole life, I have not have a piece of seafood since the spill, and never will.  Darwin is a cool guy and all, but that doesn't make him 100% right on this issue. You should speak your own mind on capitalism instead of spewing random copy-pastes. Hitler disliked capitalism too, and we have quotes. Would that make your point more credible? Get a grip on reality. Everysystemiscorrupt. Capitalism does not make it impossible to co-operate. It is not inherently corrupt.You are incredibly naive and don't understand the difference between corporatism and capitalism, don't talk shit about things you don't understand and don't quote things incorrectly. Min 1:37+ is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan: The root of the problem today, America - Where a couple hundred millionaires that barely work 2 weeks out of every month and have pensions and healthcare for life, decide what to take away from those millions of people that work 6 or 7 days a week just to make ends meet so they can give tax breaks to their wealthy friends that bankrupted the country at least twice. Criminal. Wind.  Water.  Sun. here's the full documentary guys watch?v=_KgFBciS_X0 The thermodynamic cycle of a combustion engine is way less efficient than that of steam turbines, even if the heat is generated by coal burning. So yes coal power plants pollute a lot, but electric cars would still be beneficial.
The Big Sleep 	youssef is lelijk hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh That's a big sleep. i ended up here because of Nick valentine xD check out the trailer for The Big Client
Big Wednesday 	4 years later, 8th !!! We need a Jan Michael Vincent over here! Busey was in shape damn! 3 years later... THIRD! This is totally wild, 2 years later... FIRST!
Blackout 	doesn't look that bad for low budget ! I will check it out. They should make a TV series about this Really great movie for all preppers out there. No Rambo moments, no Uncle Sam propaganda. Clean, researched and straight to the point!
Blue Collar 	Really good film this - apparently Richard Prior was off his head on cocaine and was totally paranoid, and fell out big time with Keitel and Kotto. Also, it was a very difficult film to make, and it was Paul Shrader's directorial debut. - Apparently at one point Shrader broke down in tears on set, and Prior told him to stop crying and carry on, which he did. Any job you can get is only glamourous to the unemployed. Thanks to the disappearance of unions in the US we now have the lowest wages in the industrialized world! 1 out of every 1000 union bosses were criminals while EVERY CEO on the planet is a thieving, vile, corrupt piece of shit! The movie tries to play both sides, but ALL Americans made a lot more money and had a lot more benefits when union membership was strong...today's wages are shit by comparison! I have this movie on my DVD, great movie. In america now no maded movies like this only this Marvel sheet, stupidity conquer the space, this is boolsheet full of laying dreams for stupid new generation full mouth of demokracy  yes my ass America is wrong place for living i never live there i dont want country full of contraversy..Whats a about of real life. an eye opening movie, times will never change 1978 when Japanese cars were starting to flood the american market, the guy jumps on a forktruck in A US automobile plant and the fork truck was Made by TOYOTA  to crash into a broken soda machine made in the USA.I wonder how many union shops would stand for somthing like this? I like how relatively simple this trailer is. No dramatic music nor dramatic jumpcuts. For the most part, it simply shows clips from the movie. this movie will never be released again due to what is now deemed "racist language" (just hear the final line in the movie)this is an unfortunate miscarrage of justice for the actors, crew and fans of this movie such as myself I wish Netflix would add this This film was released on the day of my birth! one of the best films very made its very entertaining Most overlooked film since the friends of Eddie Coyle... Weird that they've slipped through the cracks over the years richie incognito oj brown gayle sayers brown These companies ..shit this country want to get rid of the unions like yesterday...they dont give a fuck about the worker Filmed at the Checker Motors plant in Kalamazoo. exposes alot of what my dad remembers from the 70s Detroit auto unions. unions isnt nothing more than organized crime paid and funeded by the hard working class. Great Film!
Bog Flame Goku 	dope as fk So was this movie a box office success? And what was the budget? Why did they use the "video game" part of the movie in the trailer? Guys watch my video Has it really only been three years "Be there when a hero becomes a god". love a good headline Still EPIC AF "Be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?" Do I need to finish DBZ before watching this. Like I have not seen the buu saga Havent watch the movie, but I'm on ep 7 of Dragonball Super, and they seem the same. excelent trailer is dbz battle of gods amazing trailer I haven't seen it yet Funny to see Pilaf and his two henchmen again here. They look young but are not actually young. Now Trunks is a victim of a cougar lol. I have 40 more Episodes left to see with DBZ* I am kinda a later starter to the hole DBZ! It's been one Hell of a ride in all that I have seen. But I will say that I am In LOVE with DBZ*! I am going to be sad when it comes to the final end of the very last epsode. But I will say again its been great seeing it now on to more EPC fun in the DBZ* World lol...Now can't wait for Battle of the gods and many moe great DBZ fun!!!! So is the Dragon Ball Super or the movie is better? And does both have the same storyline? Way better than Resurrection F holy crap battle of the gods was awesome 10/10! I am a sayian raised in planet earth. I will DEFEAT YOU!!! best quote to me "I am a Saiyan that was raised on Planet Earth. I WILL.... DEFEAT YOU!!!!"Why the heck doesn't Goku say this in the movie? How many people know I am super saiyan god in the future? I should be more careful.

Welldone.  Nice!  move over nidge my mums the boss now ha amazing well worth the wait the only way is up its party time
The Boys in Company C 	with the voice of troy McClure....all you need is Rainier wolfecastle as rambo. Nobody caught that the actor that plays "Jesus" is also "Cowboy" in Fullmetal Jacket.  Semper Fi till We die! Nobody can do it like the Gunny. But the Spanish D. I. Had me rolling. Somewhere is a Marine Sargeants mess is a picture of Ermey........and the motto underneath......"We all strive to be as he" Is that you Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, is this me? Want a good vietnam film? Mopic 84 Love This Movie! I love this film far as I am concern this movie could top Full Metal Jacket anytime although R Lee Ermey was good and his role was small but Brother Stan Shaw was the star the rest of the Platoon were good as well I would like to have this as My Oldies But Goodies collection Platoon We Were Soldiers and The Walking Dead the Black Vietnam film not to be confuse with the current popular zombie horror series of the same name will be My collections as well LITTLE WING DIRTY BIRD MKULTRAMKTEK DO THE 1983 MARL PRECAPTURE MKULTRAMKTEK PRECAPTURE MKULTRAMKTEK gunny sgt Hartmann!!! 2100000;  All USMC Boots !!! It's a song that one of the actors wrote, his name is Craig Wasson.  Thank you, sir!  Saw the film as a pre-teen.  Stuck with me ever since.   You are correct. Nice job. whats the song that starts playing at 1:00 ? WTF isn't this called Full Metal Jacket haha, seriously some scenes are shot for shot the same as Full Metal Jacket, I guess Kubrick wasn't all that original he clearly stole some scenes as well as the drill instructor!
Brass Target 	Interesting, Brass Target was brought to us by Leo the Lion I only liked this movie because Cassavetes was in it.That was one hell of an actor. Both of my sisters were extras in this movie as children (I was too young, boooo!) when we lived in Munich! Sophia Loren? Robert Vaughn? All of these huge stars were in it?! I had no idea! The only one I remember hearing about is George Kennedy... THANK YOU The Jews have the German gold in their vaults, just ask the Federal Reserve. And guess what? They won't give it back!!
The Brink's Job 	comedy light drama based on real events What a great fucking cast! Is this a comedy? Didn't know Freidkin did them?
Bud and Lou 	I'm a huge fan of the team and found this TV movie very good. Can't believe some people criticizing Buddy his portrayal of Lou was spot on and his emotions are certain scenes was fantastic. The scene of wanting a new trailer and arguing with Robert Reed was nothing short of brilliant. Sorry to fans but Buddy played Lou as he really was. I've had a lot of strawberry malteds in my life but this one's the best! ~ I saw this movie on TV and it never came on again. i saw this movie a long time ago, trying to find this movie online so i can watch it again
The Buddy Holly Story 	Luv U Gary! why dont they make another one a better one with a different actor and actually use the familys help like to make it at least 80 percent accurate "And if you're not going to go out with me I want to know why"  Well, I mean you are Gary BUSEY "They think he's crazy...even dangerous"Well, it IS Gary Busey. he's playing a 70s style strat??? Great film! I love the rock star film genre Even though this movie was not accurate on so many facts as Hollywood movies usually are,  I loved Gary Busey as Buddy....loved his performance, this is probably his best. The only one in the 50's that had an unique sound in their head was Elvis Aron Presley fam Mostly fiction.  They didn't even use the real names of The Crickets, or the right number (they began as a quartet).  The Holley family blasted this movie, and rightly so. hard to imagine that Gary Busey (today) was once nominated for an  Oscar! This movie was an insult to his legacy.  So wrong in so many ways.  A piece of Hollywood garbage. It was a great movie. Amazing movie. Not accurate but gary busey deserves more respect for it.
Caravans 	Totally annoying music. Can the dumb music. Shoot the drummer. Please do a better job of showing this thing sThis a BORE and you see very little didn't like there music or the way they showed it... Cost, dimensions, whole shot of interior would have been nice. More in description. Just read they were bought out by Airstream . Don't count on a low price. What kind of toilet?  is it a compost or cassette/   More details please. You could upgrade this with a solar vacuum tube hot water heater and thermal electricity generator and even in hub electric motors with tubeless tires so no worries about getting a flat! You could use cryogenic sealed sterling cylinders to generate ultra cold temperatures to cool it has well. Novartis Use an induction stove cook top that you can also use to heat it with an induction Manson fan to move the hot air around and leave the gas for cooking outside. Novartis Design with two Axel's and with slide outs and give it a bathroom and shower.  Very cool whats the cost $ 18,000 to 25,000 or more ...because that is out of reach for most budget minded camping people like me ..? this is stylish! Never thought I'd hanker for a caravan.
The Cat from Outer Space 	Star Wars inspired Disney in strange ways back then! I enjoyed seeing this movie when it came out.  It starred both colonels from MASH too. Cats have ruled our hearts since the days of Pharaohs :) This movie is a tribute to their cuteness. I can't wait to watch it. And the moment I clicked on trailer, I said to myself: "Something tells me this is a Disney movie... ." And by the end, 'Walt Disney productions' flashed on screen :)) This was my fave movie as a kid, i dont care how crap it is i loved it It is funny how as a kid, there are movies that are such a part of our childhood, and when we are adults, we are told that these movies are crap. I loved (and still love) the Cat from Outer Space, but growing up, I read that this was considered one of Disney's worst movies, from what was considered it's worst decade of making movies (the 1970s) i saw this movie when I was a kid . my parents brought me a kitty cat . I named him Jake just like the cat in the movie It's pretty obvious to me that cats are superior creatures! imma kms need to look for this movie, seen it when I was a kid! I almost always read the book before I see the movie. The book was pretty good. IM REALLY SERIOUS But ALL cats are from outer space...LOVED this movie as a kid. Gotta rewatch. The dog from outer space sounds better 100% pour quand disney le retour du cats from outer espace the very good film mon enfance introuvable en france en dvd ou autre . I like how the cat says "I'm serious" at the end so you know it's an actual movie. wow, didnt think this was a real film, is it any good? or is it all 1950's B movie? THAT CAT IS SO CUTE We had this on VHS and this movie was my childhood! Today I bought this on View Master.  That's as far as I want to go with it.
The Cheap Detective 	The sequel to one of my favorite movies of ALL time.And a cast of 15 MAJOR stars! Madeline Kahn and others And you get to see Phil Silvers only shot in the film right in the trailer. Awesome movie!
Child of Glass 	<3 I can't remember my last name let alone remember her rhyme. Poor ghost would never be free. For years, my only memory of this was of a ghost girl fading away while singing Frere Jacques. Thirty years later I finally found out what it was! Sooo funny, I was completely smitten with that girl when I saw this as a young boy. I thought I was in love. Lol! I loved this movie, would love to watch it again. Thank you for posting this Loved this movie as a child. Thanks for posting this. I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw it at age six, I think i was in love with ghost girl, or in love with the idea of having a ghost as a friend HAHA! Look on Amazon for Disney Generation movies. This is from part of a book called Ghosts I Have Been by Richard Peck. Great book. I remembered this seems like centuries ago. This movie scared the piss out of me when I was a kid. It's like the Disney version of "The Ring."  Carrie, I would rent this movie for you, anytime!!!   ; )     lol! I had the biggest crush on this girl, as well!!! LHOTP??? And did you have a crush on the little French girl ghost, as well, like I did?

The Comeback 	thats rupauls hello hello hello PLEASE HBO WHY HAVEN`T YOU RELEASED SEASON 3 YET. I FREAKING MISS THIS SHOW SO MUCH :( not easy being green..  lol THE ABSOLUTE BEST SERIES EVER!!!!!!!!!    I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!!! She sounds like Regina Phalange lol great show, glad to see its  back... Best moment of The Comeback season 1 was Val punching Paulie D , she did what I wanted to do , fat bastard writing a stupid show Room and Board having delusions of grandeur. Absolutley UNDER~ RATED~!!!! Check it out. Season 1 was well before its time. she's  a great actress. Lisa Kudrow is so amazing "all this is ng... Not good"!!! BAHAHHW!!! want more!! there better be a season 3!! Best show on TV, only HBO is smart enough 2 get it she is so likable she could play katherine hepburn This makes me so happy What happened to the original trailer that had Girls on Film as the background music? It was much much better.  Just genius! Lisa is amazing, as always, I loooooove her! HBO HURRY AND MAKE THIS AVAILABLE FOR STREAM ON ITUNE/AMAZON PRIME, SOME OF US DONT HAVE HBO. I've waited 9 yrs for season 2 and now can't watch! :((
Comes a Horseman 	I remember seeing the movie while on flight on United Airlines from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles back in early 1979!
Coming Home 	I've the feeling I'm gonna cry like a little girl throughout this movie Gong Li is tremendous! sa ressemble a l'histoire de hatshi What was the piano piece? Such a great film but sad. The end was not what I expected. I love all about this movie just finished watching the movie.. it's a must see.. great work for real La hija de  Feng Wany (Gong Li) no es del viejo ese Chen Daoming, sino del agente  Sonny Crockett de Miami vice en que Feng Wany durante su juventud tuvo relaciones sexuales con el gringo en cuba ahi procrearon a la chinita Zhang Huiwen No me gusto el final, no es q sea mal final si no q le falto algo a ese final Is it worth it to watch? Just saw one of these remarkable films that touch you in your very deepest and remain in your heart. Gui Lai (Coming Home) by Zhang Yimou. Gong Li is amazing! I own all her movies. I wanted a happy ending but it was in a weird way has her husband was there all the time lol touching film lol awesome, touching , intense, deep movie..... Gong li is amazing actress I just saw the film, and I'm surprised that so many comments focused on the political setting when to me the film was an overwhelmingly hopeful endorsement of the awesome power of family and love over oppression. The cultural revolution could not tear them apart. He acted like a man. I cannot say that in print with the sufficient emphasis. Like a MAN. He loved her and he was willing to do the patient and humble thing to help her. It's not even about being Chinese.  It's about three people all successfully coming to terms with their grief, and grief every man, woman, and child shall have in this life, whether their families are challenged by the cultural revolution or by American secularism.  I haven't seen the daughter discussed in any review, but her role is equally heartening as she gives up her disappointment about the effect of her father's political situation on her career in ballet, and is able to be a good daughter to her parents. This is a worthy goal in human life and it is so wonderful to see it reaffirmed, when all around us in our own nation are only messages of rebellion and rupture (our own ugly cultural revolution). Gong Li the most beautiful woman in the entire world and one of the best actresses ever.
Convoy 	(To those wondering) Correct, this is not from the movie. There was a different song in the movie. From what I can tell you, it was one of these two things. Either the movie was based off of the song written by C.W. McCall, or the movie was made and then C.W. McCaall took the song and movie, changed some words up to make it sound better, and produced this song. This song and the movie are both great so I wont complain. And if you havnt seen this great movie from the 70s, go and watch it. This looks like such a goddamn masterpiece GTA v brought me here Not even the song from the movie The Rubber Duck Is A Mack R700L.Love Machine's Truck Is A Mack Cruiseliner.And Spider Mike's Truck Is A Diamond Reo. This is more of a music video then an official trailer.
Corvette Summer 	Yoda and Vader died because they watched this disco POS wow Pee Wee's Big Adventure? Is the film in backwards at times.? I ask because the driver is on the right side in some frames. I loved this when i was 7..we had HBO lol!! I feel like I've watched this a long time ago, but I barely remember it Darth Vader took it. I love it unofficial sequel to Star Wars I came for the comments lol because he plays Luke lol. Why is the steering wheel on the wrong side? Built in England, I guess. God, this is why I don't watch too many Hollywood movies.  Also I haven't had a TV for 35 years, it is all so much crap.  I know it is just a movie, but it becomes more than that year after year ..... This film was replayed or syndicated at least a few times on regular television during the early 80's. Back then remember it as an innocent and rather simple film. That was the impression back then. The corvette was good but ever since the XP-38 came out they've just in demand. Wrap your ass in fiberglass and drive a 'vette. I was an HBO addict as a kid and this was one of my faves. so my crush is obsessed with this movie. can someone explain why This was after the first star wars film.That was 77 Utterly terrible movie, didn't really help his career.  So glad he's back on track now with the new SW films :D  Met him in 2007, nice bloke.
Cruise Into Terror 	Loved this movie!  Used to have it on VHS.  Hope you can post the entire movie!
Damien 	I really liked this show. A pitty that the Bible-Fuckers got their will again. Can someone please tell me if this is any good? Or is it some kind of silly horror splatter? :-) The only great episode is the final one. What a waste of a great supernatural context... hdkdn name the song? It got canceled, but some people are trying to bring this show back, or at least find a new home to it: https://www.change.org/p/netflix-savedamien?recruiter=385623092&utm_source=petitions_share&utm_medium=copylink This trailer is annoying, you cant see whats going on because they change frame every 0,005 second se ve interesante It got cancelledThnx for wasting my time A&EYh i did enjoy watching but S1 was like a intro and S2 is where thinks are about to get amazing Is this the older Damien in the movie "The Omen"? I dig this series. Hopefully they will continue. ooh religion.. cringi AF So damien is the son of teemo???? quite frankly, I don't like lucifer when you think of lucifer you don't think good person that falls for a girl you think destruction and chaos or alot of fucked up shit and I was hoping that was the concept you don't just make a series called lucifer and make him all good and shit that's not how this shit works Amazing show Arthur what are you doing
Dawn of the Dead 	masterpiece Best zombie movie ever made need to make any other movie like this asap yo this shit needs to happen I always knew Zack Snyder directed this, but up until recently, I had no idea James Gunn wrote it. Well done film and a remake that in many ways outshines the original. Dead Rising brought me here, also, this movie scared the living shit out of me as a kid :D Nice Left 4 Dead movie :P I love this Movie!! In all of Zombie movies that i've watched this is number 1.. even World War Z can't beat this movie.. "FOR ME" Sad that Snyder Cancelled the Sequel!! Because of DC.. But I love DC too than MARVEL.. HAHHAHAAHHAHAHA My gf is going to bed before the president is announced. I told her this is what she's going to wake up to if they announce Trump as our next president LOL. SO FAR, THE BEST ZOMBIE REMAKE! hands down the best zombie movie i've seen so far isn't this the first time fresh running zombies were introduced... This movie is even more scary and better than the original You know a movie is good when you still think about it twelve years later. :)Man, this is still one of my favorite movies of all time. I nearly was 13 years old when this one came out, it freaked me out and still satisfied me without a doubt. Even when I was done with the movie I got the special edition for the DVD with all the extras in it. Deleted Scenes, Extra Footage from Andy, The News Channel and other Survivors documenting the outbreak and all. Man, such a cool remake... one of the best movies from Znyder. It was so simple and yet entertaining at the same time. Maybe I'm going to watch it one more time, just one more frigging time. It's not like that I've watched this movie around 100 times. CJ and Michael were my favorite characters, so sad that they've had to die. Great movie, shit trailer. You know what's ironic? The screenplay was written by the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, but it was directed by the director of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman State of decay the movie Brilliant remake of a 1978 masterpiece! i was against this at first as i've been a fan of the original since 1988 when i was 6 when i rented Night of the Living Dead then Dawn then Day and when i heard a remake of this was gonna be made i was skeptical, i mean if Night of the Living Dead in 1990 was good then so should this, i saw this in theaters and was surprised. Surprisingly good and well made. 0:57Theres a game called "No More Room In Hell" and it has the same texr just like that one. This is the best zombie movie ever made
Deadman's Curve 	I'm feeling a little woozy here! Matthew Lillard is so kickass in this movie.  Tim Jackson is the ultimate Magnificent Bastard. Da fuck. Haven't seen the film but I'm assuming that the twist is the guy never died? ...Why would they give that away in a trailer Hmmm faise one complete Very good It's a good movie with a crazy twist looks ok.
Death on the Nile 	Angela Lansbury gets murdered... it was funny to see her get shot in the head like that. Also funny how Mia Farrow was one of the killers then she killed herself. The costumes won an Oscar. I have to watch this every so often, at least once a year or I get itchy. Wow. I have never seen a movie with so many brilliant actors, I love. I mean Angela Lansbury, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Bette Davis and Peter Ustinov. in my school this is my story I love this movie! Shame we cant watch the full Ustinov movie without paying! Its very good. la encontre Definitely genius Agatha Christie!!The second book I've read.. Angela, Bette, Maggie and Mia... 1978... I had a dream that PIEGUYRULZ talked about these three big slides.  One of the was red, one was yellow, and one was green.  Once you reach the bottom, you can go back up the stairs to the top, or, if you're skilled enough, you can run up a slide.  This dream was probably caused by the fact that I was at the fair last night.  There were some other people there, including Simon and Linnet Doyle.  In the dream, I was PIEGUYRULZ for some parts and Simon for others.  As Simon, I slid down the red slide with Linnet.  The plan was for me to kill her once we reached the bottom.  Not with a gun, just with my hands.  I peed while sliding and may have even pooped a little.  I don't think I reached the bottom of the slide.   Peter Ustinov WOW DeathOnTheNile.rar 74.2 MBhttps://mega.co.nz/#!W8Zk3SBQ!H2FrXIxWmBUTPLg-XNlqihoiAK9WsQlqGa_O0bfHBq0 I just love David's role here I like this type of movie, I hope they can remake Charlie Chan lol. my english teacher spoiled it for me :'( No, frankly he was OK. Specially as he was 39 and not shaped like the character. I was doubtful too at first but he won me over in the course. I saw this movie...I love it so much ;_; Brilliant cast. I need to see this!
Deathsport 	CLAUDIA JENNINGS RIP was a BEAUTIFUL TALENTED UNIQUE ACTRESS A 70s LEGEND.Claudia Jennings died tragically 3-10-79 (car crash) but her life/films will live FOREVER ++Claudia Jennings was GREAT in STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO 75, GATOR BAIT 74 ETC ..JOHN SAXON IS A FILM TV GREAT LEGEND ONE OF THE BEST ACTORS 50s 60s 70s 80s So this is where the sample from the track Death Sport by Hazard came from lmao Love it!!! in the year 3000 they have really shitty bikes They don't make like they use ta..... Sweet flick! Lots of explosions and men on fire, this film has it all. RIP Richard Lynch!! what's with the Star Wars sound effects? I have this on vhs, its shit-tastic. looks like a cheesy sequel to that death race 2000 film Loved the tits in the flick....other than that this movie was bad. It has some of the most annoying sound effects ever...and they're constant too! @samalvor lol right Sadly, this trailer is way more fun than the actual film, which is inexcusably dull. @pinkdestroyer What?  It's got blasters and laser guns! Wow!!! This looks like reall shit-movie!!!
The Deer Hunter 	Movie name, please??? Watcccch The Deeeeeer Hunteeeer oooonlineee here => https://twitter.com/bab64f69ae40a1e7d/status/850530171740233729 good movie but bad trailer Great movie.  Terrible trailer. Yoou can waaaatch The Deeer Hunter hereeee https://twitter.com/8b36ebdf88f2dde48/status/850530171740233729 I watched The Deer Hunter full movieeee here https://twitter.com/3812ba2034e26a8c4/status/850530171740233729 the trailer actually encapsulates the spirit of cimino's classic.  eh, you fucking braindead fucking  humps??? I really like that dark sound When the "Deer Hunter" comes up. The Deer what ? didn't have the time to catch the last word How could they not include De Niro's hardcore, blood curdling scream from when they're playing Russian roulette in Vietnam? That sells the movie right there. How could they not include De Niro's hardcore, blood curdling scream from when they're playing Russian roulette in Vietnam? That sells the movie right there. Why the fuck did movie trailers spoil the entire plot back then? The problem with this trailer is not that it reminds you every two seconds what the name of the movie is (I guess it's just the way they used to make trailers back in the day - some text and proper fragments of the movie changing on your screen - watch the trailer for "A Clockwork Orange") you are just supposed to rember the title. The problem is that the trailer basically summarises the whole film so there is not much place left for surprises as you know that in the end (SPOILER) Michael's going to find Nick in Vietnam playing Russian roulette for sport/money and (SPOILER) Nick's going to die. rip john cazale The Deer Hunter So what is the movie called?  I didn't quite catch it They use a real bullet in this movie .. And 28 people die for this movie
Devil Dog 	I used to LOVE this movie; I haven't seen it in decades!!!= - O. It could have its purpose in real life , Let say the satanic cult works with the gouvernement ..they could always give a puppy to poetin ... ohh no ...poetin is already a demon ... I watched this as a kid, me and my sister laughed our behinds off.  Scared the hell out of me when i seen this as alittle kid haha looks tame now its got a Dolls kinda feel t it, with the Spanish maid and all Oh my, that looks just like my dog... So it's basically like the exorcism but dog style This is one fun movie. It's impossible to watch this and not be entertained. this scared the shit out of me when this first aired and i was 16. seemed too scarey to be on tv this could be a good remake if done by the right people For real, people: it's spelled chihuahua. Great freaken movie.I remember watching it and being scared myself (at 17),and at the same time thinking "What a cool dog to have",as long as you didn't piss it off.Thanks for posting this.I was thinking of the movie the other day and wondering if I got the title right after thirty-four years. A mixture of cujo and the omen Is this like the hound of the baskervilles? Haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, back when TV movies were good. Crazy old movie. Chihauhau's,ARE NOT FREAKIN EVIL beverly hills chihuahau,proves it!Ali,and Papi jr,are freakin adoralbe!And so are Rose and Jo,my friends chi's.SO THERE!HA! @lassiefan97 You want a dog that kills people with his mind?WHATS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?!

A Different Story 	Talented and real, that's the George I'll always miss. God bless G Mike Just love his honesty.  So forthright, unashamed and totally gorgeous.  Such a huge loss to everyone of his friends, family and devoted fans. "Oh my God! I am a massive star... and I think I may be a poof! " Damn it, rest in peace George! Best thing about WHAM is that they split when they were at peak... Not waiting till either of them got pissed off at each other. They could have stayed together for another couple of albums which may or may not be as successful as previous ones and yet could have bagged a large sum of money... And they never did a reunion which I always dream about but there're certain things which I think we  should keep it as it is rather than re-creating it. And WHAM is one of them. efsane Laurence Lambert mandame una copia como bajo el dvd de GEORGE MICHel a different hostiry Oh bless you George. We love you and I hope that you can fight your inner demons and continue to keep making beautiful music like you are doing right now. :) come on, someone please post all of this documentary...Kirk..Montreal, Canada hey can u tell me where i can c it? If someone is interested in the movie,write me on PM,I'll give you link :) He is SO absolute fantastic, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE HIS accent ..:Woooah *.* I hope it will be onsale when I go to see him in 2 weeks :O TWO WEEKS!o_O This DVD was sold only at his concerts.  I got it, and when I take the time to figure out how to post on youtube, I will do it.  He takes the viewers to his childhood house, introduce his friends, ....it's a great insight into his life.  I adore George. I would lov eto see it as well, where can I get it ? Could you show the entire documentary, perhaps? Thank you.
Don 	What is Hindi waht is Urdu ? THIS IS STYLE unfortunately when it released I was only 3 years old Srk is the best at acting especially the Don series AWESOME TRAILER !! Way better than original .. Best Trailer yes who is it..DON DON...DON... This trailer better than Don 2 srk: super mercurial !!!!!! srk: super energy !!!!! Apple' Apple' who wants to see RAEES??? This movie shows how srk can perform Amitabh role may be that's why he is king timing , speed , judgement , when you saying hello to raven in reply he will say Hi from Data always best wow Some Indian people spreading negativity against shahrukh Khan and some Indian people spreading bad rumours against shahrukh Khan...... Shahrukh Khan is always no 1actor still watching 2016 watching in 2016 amazing trailer. ..
Dr. Strange 	la ame excelente The hot doctor is my favourite thing in the movie I like to watch movies Doctor strange 2 doctor strange y antiman Dr.Strange:Dormamu! i've come to bargain!Dormamu:You've come to die! Watching most superhero movies; "This doesn't make any sense."Writers; "Not everything does, not everything has to" Have you seen that before in a gift shop? best trip mary Doraemon, I've come to bargain Doctor Strange full movie https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjPCXR1Trif0UdOICjzJNLp-Gb_MYu_zvbhHs4_GCpc/edit?usp=sharing Best trailer.I like it.Doctor Strange is great movie. the glass effect is soo awesome wow I want Doctor Strange 2 to:Be set in New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou......where the Nexus of All Realities is opening......and Doctor strange teams up with local sorcerer Jericho Drumm (aka Brother Voodoo, but they never call him that) to investigate......a series of killings committed by Man-Thing, who is burning people alive for no apparent reason......but it's actually because they'e been possessed by Nightmare through their dreams, and he's using them to open the Nexus of All Realities so that he can manifest completely in this world.Nightmare would be an awesome villain because he really loves psychological manipulation, and Stephen Strange has a lot of psychological weak points. Strange is hyper-rational, but Nightmare is hyper-emotional, so he'd be a great foil.And Man-Thing is perfect for using as a fake-out villain. Marvel fans who actually know the character (which is not most of them) won't be fooled, but Joe Q. Public will totally buy that he's a monster and be shocked when he's revealed as a mystical guardian.And you could even throw in Howard the Duck, who gets pulled through the Nexus to Earth.Oh and use different and creative magic other than Kung fu! Plenty of existing heroes due martial arts. Be creative and have strange using curse spells, demon/ construct summongings, teleportation without sling ring. Start developing his relationships with magic entities like cyttorak by having him gain contracts to use their magicPush the boundaries of pg-13 by giving derrickson creative freedom to make this a  more horror based non generic sequel mcu series. And make it longer! 2 hours and 30 minutes to three hours !!! Meta physical beings, million years ago depicted in Vedic texts..all these concepts.. sri krishna! Basically, it's a 2 hour clutter of borrowed and extremely overused cliches, as hollow as Hollywood itself. There is, literally, nothing original about this film and nothing worth wasting a minute of your life on, unless you are as disjointed and shallow as the people who created it and the others who whored themselves to participate in this mess. I'm specifically referring to certain actors who are better than this and who should know better. Tilda Swindon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong; what, were you short on cash, gone brain-dead or taken complete leave of your artistic integrity? what a terrible american accent bargain I've come to dormamu great movie
Dracula's Dog 	i just saw this on TCM this past Sunday My understanding is that this is also called "Dracula's Dog." I believe it's available on Amazon Prime Video. Rifftrax does the same thing as well if you like Mike. MS3TK is back, more or less.Check out Cinematic Titanic (.com). It's the original creator of MST3K - Joel, and a lot of the MST3K cast. MST3K, we need you back real quick... "I must have the blood of my descendant! Oh wait, 'Dallas' is on. Bah, I'll just send Zoltan." ahhaahahaahahhhahaahah Ready to chase it if thrown? If you presented a crucifix to Zoltan would he cower and melt or chew on it? Also watch "Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell (1978)" They should have the dog wear sunglasses like most vampires. I think this looks good. I'm going to have to find it! this is so scarey and i'am only 9 bitches I wish they'd resurrect Dracula's Dog & sick him on the cast of Twilight. @bucky468 Dracula's dog and Zoltan: Hound of Dracula is the same movie.  If you visit the IMDB-page of Dracula's dog, you'll see that it says "Zoltan: Hound of Dracula" on the poster. 2:28-2:32 truly inspired! Does 'Drake' turn into a vampire or not? That's all I wanna know now lol @bucky468 yeah it is... Devil Dog: Hound of Hell trailer it's right here --->>> That's Barlow from Salem's Lot at 1:56. I came across this when I was searching for the cult classic flick "Dracula's Dog." Too bad that flick ain't at YouTube.
The Driver 	U people are try keep it up. Hotline Miami How to spoil a movie in 2 minutes This is such an awesome movie, whatever I say, it will not do it justice. 16 seconds in I've made the smart choice of just watching the movie Glad I watched the movie first... There should not have been a fucking trailer for this masterpiece *Watches trailer**looks at comments*Wait, so I basically screwed up by watching the trailer before the movie? Crap. I'm so glad Drive isn't an action movie (like this trailer paints it out to be) in reality it's one of the greatest films of all time I just watched Drive and came back to let anyone know that this trailer doesn't even remotely capture the tone of the movie. Probably one of the best films I've seen to date and I firmly regret not seeing it over this abysmal trailer. Never saw it assuming it was yet another generic movie with car chases similar to fast and furious 1-23. Such was not the case. The directing, sound track, acting, etc are top tier. The supporting actors - a who's who of great actors - are excellent all around. The movie has a very film noir feel to it and the violence graphic. Sort of Good Fella's meets Miami Vice. This is a tense, taut, tight movie, that takes some time to get into. I did find the ending very unsatisfying, which feels sloppy and rushed; maybe intentional by the director, but it didn't work for me for what's an otherwise solid movie. With just a few tweaks and a better ending, could have been a classic. A-/B+ This trailer just showed the whole movie, and that too in chronological order of the scenes that takes place in the movie. Do not watch this trailer if you haven't seen this movie yet. Great movie, Terrible trailer editing. I think the trailer has 80% of Gosling's lines in it. I just came from watching the movie, this trailer is the movie in 2 minutes 30 seconds lmao I know I'm 6 years late but this is a really great movie Baby driver) Great movie. Glad i didn't watch the trailer before seeing it though. Spoils everything. I just finished watching the movie and it was really good like I was hooked right away and the soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks that I've ever heard. Gotta see film again as I thought it sucked the first time Worst trailer I have ever seen. Spoils everything. DO NOT WATCH THIS BEFORE YOU HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE MOVIE!
Every Which Way But Loose 	this movie is so fucking hallarious "Twelve ribs my @ss!!........Goddammit" Great movie but the title never made sense to me. if ANYBODY knows who that girl is when Orville says  ''SAY UH IT KINDA SMOKY IN HERE " shes gorgeous .    Let me know Man, i watched it so many times on cable with my dad. Im 38 now, so many good memories thinking of this film. And everyone said my dad looked like Eastwood........ right turn clyde!!!! :-) Im going to wacth the remake 20 somthing instead. One classic movie. I wish put this movie and any which way can together . I enjoy both. If have on blue ray . Lots great songs.  Good quilty sound.   Lindo,lindo,saudades desse filme. I really want to watch it, but i can't find the full Movie. BRILLIANT MOVIE, I watched it way back then when it came out. L.o.l....Can't say anything else, cos he's soo funny...lol,,,,, Are you kidding? He looked like fucking Skeletor at the Republican convention and those vitamins have mashed his brain. This trailer took a ride on the crazy train. I'm talking about the couple narrating their way through the trailer so bizarre.    Funny and weird at the same time trailer The two greatest movie entertainment films ever made !! and when ma goes for her driving test fails quite a few times if she had her glasses on in the first place she would not have failed still glad she passes in the end right turn clyde overall i give this 10 out of 10 great funny movie they dont make them like this anymore love ma very funny lady played by the wonderful ruth gordon orville played by the great underated geffory lewis the funniest orangutan on earth clyde amazing beverly d angelo as echo what echo and sondra locke clint's first wife as lynn halsey taylor i don't mind country music that much charlie rich sings a great song in this film the black widow gang must be the unluckyist biker gang ever lol love it when ma takes a shot at their bikes lol The monkey Ed impersonates in Shaun of the dead I got this on blue ray!!!! Love this movie nu.1 in my book! :D
The Evil 	will be a cult classic. What The FUCK!? What the fuck boy? i think this will be good I'm hella hype to watch but b4 I do does the bald grey pedophile rape the kid in the trailer just now? Man that ending with the massive corpse puppet show... Fuck this was good Fred Koehler is AMAZING in this flick. The fuckin Worst horror film i've ever witness You never go full retard. where is hilary clinton? this movie is really good. probably the best horror movie in 2017 its in my opinion the genius part of the boy made his way back into reality while the disabled part that was living in reality went back into the darkness of his mind he needed to kill to trigger a reaction to switch sides this looks creepy WOW... " Production of the film began in 2002, but was plagued by many delays including: funding issues, conflicts with cast, and a lawsuit from a studio assistant. After many stops and starts to the production, filming was completed in 2008. Getty began obsessing over the final edit of the film and spent many years working to perfect it, but he unfortunately died in 2015 before it could be completed. Producer Michael Luceri, who had also assisted with the editing, finished the film. " wow this looks even crappier than the game... It was a good different movie. I prefer these effects to CGI she igans. BTW the movie is insane from start to finish. No wonder... the director was a meth addict that died in 2015. Worth watching. fan film ? actors are having it hard in Hollywood getting a good gig This is how a movie looks when you sellect your neighbours to be the casts with a budget of $100..
Like Father, Like Son 	Just used one large pack of tissue for this movie. Superb and touching af. :"( If anyone has doubts about this movie, I would recommend watching it. It's a great film about Japan's cultural views and a story between two families that are put into a situation where there isn't a clear answer to the problem. Just saw this movie yesterday evening and it really moved me.Wonderfull! Japanese actors are just so much better at acting than some notable American actors. I know because I'm American. This movie is soooo good i usually hate movies but this was wonderful there was a similar case like this in guatemala does someone knows the beautiful song name? Great movie Far one of the best movies I've seen. No wonder why they didnt succpect in the beginning, japaness look all the same  This movie, I swear, is one of the best...I felt hugging my nephew after watching... one of the best japanese movie of 2013 :)and it won several awards.. so cute but sad and confusing at the same time!
Eyes of Laura Mars 	Thanks for the upload...!! that Cheesy Streisand song, singing... she was so overrated, the ugly Zionist shill whore. Great movie though aside from that horrible song. great movie, i hope they don't remake this ! I wonder if there was a Foo Too Shoot in Foogue or Hoopers where a Crown Vic blew up just like that Crown Vic Taxi that was headed to JFK in Jersey with that little model from Florida. We are told the Crown Vic stalled or something and then was rear-ended turning the taxi into a Nazi Oven! All that was left was the Chanel Logo from her bag! Go Figure! It's got problems but I still enjoy watching it...It's SO 70's! I don't know why but almost all of Faye's clothes in this film are hideous. Streisand singing Widescreen at the end is fabulous...Jon Peters directed this while he was dating Streisand so naturally she did the big songs. I'd give it a solid 3 stars. Fuck this movie raul julia is to be in this movie many thanks for this wonderful movie Ca aussi c'est un film  a voir c'est une parodie " les yeux de Laura Mars " the eyes of Laurent Mars"  de Bernard Duverger voici le lien : http://bernardduverger.wifeo.com One of the best movies!!

Eileen Bren 's character reminds me of the legendary Alison Steele who I loved listening to on WNEW back in the day. please upload this movie a.s.a.p.! Whatever you say about the movie, you have to like the soundtrack! Gibts den auch auf deutsch ?Hab neulich die Platte davon gefunden.. die Musik ist eigentlich ganz gut :) The movie wasnt that bad. People on YouTube tend yo Exaggerate.Batman and Robin and catwoman were Bad.This was just a typical 70's film that slipped into the Ether and was forgotten.It was a time capsule into 1978 and had some great concert footage.The creator of the legendary WKRP says that he didnt put the finishing polish on that show after seeing this, but thats debatable as the similarities are insane.They even have a Travis type dude, a Johnny fever dude and a Venus dude.To much simularity to be " coincidental'.The film also had a great soundtrack.Used to come on every year or so, now, cant find it Anywhere?DVD copies on Amazon are pricey$$$.A very Rare Film. Yep...
A Family Upside Down 	I remember watching this made-for-tv movie when I was in high school.  Brings back memories.  The late 1970s and early 1980s were nice and uncomplicated. so glad realized this and got out at the end. will probably live way longer on his own. totally did not need a nursing home...walking in park? should have never left their apartment.... a mild heart attack and suddenly they can't live in their own apartment? a little overboard here. both were ambulatory and independent. wife who didn't work could clean and run errands three times a week. drop of meals. hardly unable to live on their own. I work in cardiac care. no reason to totally move over one staircase. a little unrealistic. could recover at a son's for a few weeks Aw<3 Wasn't this a remake of the film, with James Stewart and Bette Davis, where they are getting bad health, and neighbors complained about them and all their cats ???They decided to take their own lives, and leave together. And so they did. Very nice
Fingers 	This was remade in a French edition in 2005 starring Romain Duris in the Keitel part entitled 'The Beat That My Heart Skipped'. great film with the greatest keitel performance that should have made him a major star tisa farrow...? Awesome movie!! Look for Jim Brown as a pimp in the end! Criminally underrated movie.  This movie is awful.  It's beyond awful.  It's as though Toback had gone to the Martin Scorsese Film Camp for Wannabe Auteurs and made this movie as his final project.  The problem is simply that every scene is unbelievable.  If you want to watch a film about a pianist living "on the edge," go straight to FIVE EASY PIECES.  But avoid FINGERS! If you mean the piano piece it's Bach - Toccata in E Minor Pls Let me Know whicht is the Music That starts at 2:18.HELP ME Epic!
A Fire in the Sky 	I just saw this movie on DVD last night Unbelievable they misspelled Craig Sheffer's name in this teaser.  Graig Sheffer.  Look at it.  Terrible. Wow. fucking aliens!!terror del bueno!! based on a true story haha since when is alien life proven.... I would like to know why aliens in movies are always always naked!??  I mean they never have any sort of clothing or protective layers on! and they are always the same color, grey or dark grey or something like that. Does anyone have an answer??  thanks. they took me!!! fire in the sky qoute GMM anyone? Love this flick! +MrMonkeebalz this trailer is from 1993. This is the most boring trailer I've ever watched Based on a true story = an explainable event blown completely out of proportion. Space suits! i have listened to travis interview he says that movie is not 100% his story The film is not a true story though, It's just based on one the day i stumbled upon (coincidentally) Jacques Vallee's ewxcellent/definitive book on the UFO phenomenon's the time after I've seen this movie at the cinema, I've Bill Barry's account of Travis Walton's story ULTIMATE ENCOUNTER all along since grade school-- and this movie (based from The Travis Experience, written account of Walton himself) seems far too different
First, You Cry 	When did this come out ITS NOT A LOVE STORY is that hannah baker? we already know how it will end , just like any other sad dying somebody movie , at the end she dies obviously then he gets mad and everything ends up with a big stupid advice and they leave us feeling empty and broken , i love olivia but thank you i had my share of these kind of movies For a second she looked like Katherine Langford What's the first song??!!! i loved it as soon as i heard the song playing <3<3<3<3<3<3 Milky Chaaaanceee The hospital scene where Greg shows the movie that he has made for Rachel has forever been etched in my memory. Funny how something so depressing can also be so beautiful. This movie was actually good yeah, earl moved to angel grove and became power ranger. Watched this movie on a plane but seeing this trailer making me wanna watch it again This is a movie?! i read the book and i had no idea, lol. when i heard the lumineers and imagine dragons i gone wild Where are all of the hot boy/celebrities posters on her walls omg he looks so much like Tom Odell I love this movie but I didn't know Imagine Dragons had a song for this! what song is that again? I loved the book when I first read it. I am so happy that there is now a movie of it.
Force 	10 from Navarone a great movie and the storm approaches by Billies fireworks The cast was just awesome for this film, you got about 3 actors from Indiana Jones, Harrison ofcourse and Gabrielle Byrne who was the Nazi officer in Last Crusade as well as the guy who played Hitler he was in this too. Im surprised this film is so little known or talked about now. Billionaire Ransom Comes Out On August 19TH! Mallory was American in guns of navarone and English in this film nice trick Whooo The cast! This movie is best. love this movie
Foul Play 	Boring truly boring, Whats up Doc is so much better It's like they picked the worst scenes in the movie to make their trailer What in the fuuuck is this, in Kat Williams voice! There should be a Colin Higgins Blu-Ray box set: this, Silver Streak, 9 to 5, Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and Harold and Maude. Charming comedic thriller, a gem! Made me realize both Chase's and Hawn's talent for the first time. I miss good movies, and I am only 23. This was a great comedy. Chevy and Goldie were great and Dudley Moore was hysterical... Background music sound liked from the soundtrack of THE BIG BUS ? He is the bible salesman getting hit with the broom.@ 0:28 Who's JJ MacKuan??? J.J. MacKuan disliked this video!!! Nowadays this probably would have been rated PG-13. RIP Farrah but she would have ruined this movie.She had that look at me I'm so pretty syndrome.Goldie just had great comedic presence.  Goldie was so much better tham Farrah would have been, her and Chevy had great chemistry, Farrah and Chevy did act together in the dreadful "Man of the House" and had Zero Chemistry...on a side note Tim Conway was asked to play Dudley Moore's Role but turned it down! Goldie's role was actually written for Farrah Fawcett. When she quit Charlie's Angels and was sued the Foul Play offer was recinded and given to Goldie. I'll always wonder what Farrah and Chevy would've been like together. Farrah tried to then make her own "Foul Play" with "Somebody Killed Her Husband" (1978), which just happened a little too late, plus was probably set up to fail by Charlie's Angels producers Spelling/Goldberg,imho. You just don't cross people in Hollywood. @jksonny Your not the only one..the first time I saw a weird looking person..this movie aint good for the kiddies...but now I can laugh about it. @skawashers it is out of print, but you can find it on Amazon! @hamletmiss you know I did that video on one of my old channels, think I still have it somewhwere, will look for it! paloma-   drop the acid . remember some of us dont have family some of us have oozies
The Fury 	wat a great movie. just seen it! Comparing this movie to Saving Private Ryan and Platoon, this felt pretty watered down. The tank battles were cool to watch though. You do realize this movie is from a Japanese company. I hope one day hollywood decide to make movie about world war ii in th eastern front !!The western front is nothing more than childs play for nazi troops, eastern front is a living hell for nazi fuckface !!Imagine if hollywood makes movie about the battle of kursk, or siege of st petersburg ( leningrad)It would be awesome right cause the germans outnumbered the allies in both ww This was such a great movie. I wish I could find more like this. It takes forever to find one decent film on Kodi. The reason there aren't any German POV movies: do you really wanna watch a movie about nazis killing Americans? It's hard enough to watch holocaust movies. m4 good so funny For all who has'nt seen this Movie yet. It's a great film. Just watch it ignore the comments they didn't even watched it and postet this comments. But i watched it and its very great! I promise you won't be sorry after watching!!! I give this Movie 8/10 points. And a message to all that Neo-Nazis here: This Sherman Tank is not a regular Sherman its the M4A3E8 SHERMAN and another fact The TIGER 1  is WEAK at his BACK!! Morons go learn History or play World of Tanks. This movie sucked. please make fury 2 the greatest comedy what i saw.  A Sherman Tank shoot a Tiger in a duell. i must laughing. and by last scene a lot of SS-Warrior attack without brain the tank from all side and have no bazooka. i must laughing. Two SS-soldier it would be enough to kill a completly Sherman from the side. They would take him as breakfast. The soldiers what have at most and the best fight experienece ever would kill from this mixed-scum in a bad quality tank. the greatest comedy. This movie was dope ashell What if you make fury 2 she igans I love the Tiger in this u know what these movies are lack of? actors. it lacks of actors like tom hanks. this movie suck co to za muzyka?
Gas Pump Girls 	when Hulu was free I saw this and it was funny. it on Amazon This movie was filmed in Sacramento, CA, at a now-abandoned gas station at the northwest corner of Marysville and Arcade Blvds. OH A D!CK JOKE, HARHARHARHARR(But no, seriously, looks worth a watch!) So Basically its a Hooters Gas Station. Who is the babe at 0:37? WOW!!!! It's on dvd wheres the dirty vultures???????  @FrkSmackThat6 It's on Amazon VOD, and was on Hulu for a while but not right now. They did a nice new transfer so put out the DVD already! Best movie ever filmed in Sacramento! Just drove by the location last week (the gas station has been a California Recycling Center the past few years.) I seen this for the first time the other day on comcast free movies. I give it a high five!!! Yeah, Baby! I rented this on the sly in 1999 when I was 16 and too young to rent anything hardcore.  But somehow my dad found the video, and the title struck him as so hilarious that he's never let me hear the end of it since.  XP hiliarously stupid comedy!
Gates of Heaven 	Song is mostly "Honky Tonk Women" but also messing around a bit. A brillliant movie about lifs journey The guy playing the guitar on the hill, what's the name of the song or is he just improvising?
Girlfriends 	i want to part of this movie All I want to know is where can I purchase the movie so I can watch it. aww :-( really wanted to see it all i want 2 kn is why i cant see the full movie on youtube............ My boy Russell make it boom bang this was better than part 1 <3 <3 <3 Looks funny Looks funny Jungle bunnies returning to the jungle? What an original idea for a movie. Disney should pick up this one. It will be better than the lion king. This shit is low budget.....PERIOD!!!!!!!!!! cant wait ........my country is starring It was good , but it reflect and damage the rep of trinidad ,drugs , theif ,kidnap,corrupted police , I think I want to see it because it was done in my country...... Garbage!!!!!!! Kudos to my girls Cas Beedles and Terri J Vaughn on the production of this film....way to go, GIRL POWER! Well i cyah wait to c dis lolz Wow giving BET a run for their money I know the the crew had a wonderful time visiting my country, Trinidad. I'm so looking forward to seeing this movie! Being Trinidadian, I'm excited to see this movie. I hope its a huge sucess.
The Glove 	non vediamo l'ora di vederlo! oh mamma che bravi, davvero accattivante! Spero potrete fare carriera Da vedere assolutamente!!!
Go Tell the Spartans 	This film looks shit This trailer makes the film look like an action movie whereas in reality it's an anti-war film condemning the brutality and absurdity of the Vietnam War. ugh One of the most overlooked movies about the war in general ... and the vietnam wars in detail
Goin' South 	Buzzards can fly.........and they keep the desert clean !      LMAO !!! Love when he hollers out 'What's for Breakfast' and all the chickens take off running! We was just sayin' how much we needed a figgerine. Is there any kindly owner of the complete movie with enough altruism and philanthropy in their soul to share it with us poor deprived fellow citizens??!! The best line from this movie, right up there with all time greatest movie lines: "Poultry's just another word for chicken." False advertising. Not a trailer. Just bought the DVD at Big Lots for $3. Doesn't have the trailer, so I was hoping to find it online. Cracking film. "You know, for an outlaw, you're a pretty good friend." I cook!
The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank 	I read the book loved the movie Looks like the neighborhood from Poltergeist Erma Bombeck's newspaper columns and books were a hoot as I recall! I'd seen this movie before years ago. Carol Burnett does a great job with the role based on Bombeck and her character in the book. I should note, I'm pretty sure that's Erin in the fast food place scene :) Reminds me of 1948 'Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House'*, but not as funny. A must see if you haven't already. *Cary Grant/Mryna Loy wonderful upload, thanks ) ) ) l just noticed Linda Grey from Dallas in the scene swinging her famous leg: it was used on the marquee poster for the movie "The Graduate." Just a bit of cocktail trivia. Loved this movie it is so accurate & humorous. Glad I had the chance to see it again. Oh wow! I saw this on TV a long, long time ago when I was a kid. I don't think I ever watched the entire thing but I remember the parts about the house not working correctly. Funny how they made a big deal about living in NYC yet those suburbs look an awful lot like the San Fer do Valley in Los Angeles. Just how far west did they move?? Bless you for posting this. Been looking for it for decades LOL Good movie thanks for posting.Funny, now some people's dream is to live in the city. The yuppies are buying up all the ghettos and turning them into high rises. Now the hood rats are migrating to the suburbs. Here in Houston many of the subdivisions that were built around this time just outside the city have become ghetto (renters/section 8).Others want to be minimalist and live in a home that is very small.I personally think the suburban life is ideal as long as you go in with the right mindset and don't overdo it. The Mcmansion is overdoing it. A 1500 to 2500 sqft house is all most families need. It should to be lived in like the house in this movie was. It doesn't need expensive floors, tile, appliances and fixtures. The kids shouldn't need to take their shoes off and only play in the play room to keep the floors pristine. It should be comfortable and feel free. If it gets dirty work together to clean it up. Kids should be able to roam freely in the neighborhood and the community should have a general consensus on how things are done so everyone can get along. Regardless what the PC police tells you, the most happy communities are ones where people have a lot in common with each other. There should be no busing or low income houses to fill racial quotas. Clean up the bad neighborhood instead of making the problem everyone else. Neighbors should know one another and look out for one other. HOA's should have reasonable rules and residence should be able to make their house look the way they want it to within reason. Politics and agenda's should stay out of the schools, but parents should be allowed to be a part of the kids school year. Been looking for this for years. Haven't seen this since the early 90s. Thank you for posting! Thank you so much for posting this =^) by a lonely mugger why are they using the opening credits from Archie Bunkers Place? Enjoyed the movie but it made me glad I'm single and living in the city this was great - thanks for sharing it! :o)
Grayeagle 	LOVE this film.... a great one.... Alex Cord is AMAZING... Lana Wood is GORGEOUS.... I watched Grey Eagle when I was a little girl.  I remember when my grandfather rented the movie.

Wish they would have made a sequel.

You were 10X as beautiful in IDOJ! This song always reminds me of first grade when my dad (who was an insurance man mind you) socked it to my school after they accused him of abuse because I showed up to school with bruises and a black eye because I fell on the basement steps at home when carrying a new doll to show mom and in my excitement missed the last step. His response was a letter informing them that I've come home from school with scrapes and bruises from falling on their playground equipment lol good tune.
Here Come the Tigers 	I watched this movie today. Good stuff! Thanks for posting.
A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich 	it's on hulu The young actor was not Kevin Hooks. It was Larry B. Scott. @1pipe13 check out ap20 she has the movie uploaded as aheroaintnothingbutasandiwch I've been looking for this movie...man this takes me back to elementary/middle school.... @erickamae1984 Amazon can you please upload this on youtube. Kevin Hooks is in the movie but that's nit him when they mention his name. They always do that. Many times you can have a principal role and they'll ignore you because your name is not as big in the media as someone else. It's stupid business. In the book, the White teacher and his stepfather are the only people with any work ethic. i have this on vhs this movie was taken i n carver middle school were i go barnes and nobles got all the movies old and new try barnes and nobles man good movie i really loved it it reminds me of my life ah i miss this movie so much You're right. The star is Larry B. Scott. the young boy IS NOT kevin hooks!!! where can i find this dvd I have this on DVD. Great film!!
High-Ballin' 	Jerry Reed is the man. I have the book that came out in 1978 i don't understand why he never made an appearance on the dukes of hazzard. i know why burt reynolds didn't though because i'm sure he thought he was to big of a star at the time.i guarantee you they were asked though. Cab over face I love this  move A Canadian movie with Jerry Reed and Peter Fonda? BRILLIANT!!! sort like White Line Fever and Convoy which make in 1970's High-Rollin'. Not High-Ballin' but Rollin'. I don't get it! LMAO!:D Jerry Reed died in 2008 wateva happend  2  jerry  reed   is  he  still around   aka  bama mccall in burt reynold  movie  gator YYYEP very good movie... I have a Question... Whats that song on 2:40s...?  Watched this last night.  Loved it!Jerry Reed is pretty much the best there is.
The Hills Have Eyes 	the hills have eyes vs wrong turnwhich is better what  Song  ????? I seen this movie its was beyond awesome good one In the second movie start that girl was that youngest sister ? who survived in first movie ? what happened with them who survived in first movie ? me gusta esta pelicula this is meant to be based on a true story  but  the people in the caves were all inbred and yeah ate other humans but i dont think they were all deformed like the guys in this film their like radioactive  mutants Where is the full movie now I like this movie a lot can you please bring it back on you tube Very good trailer that's why u should never ever cross the desert by car What's the name of the song this movie sucks! WTF is wrong with these people, why have dogs when you don't give a flying fuck about them! Scumbags, as soon as the first dog went missing, I was just waiting for Bobby, the three stupid bitches and the equally fucking stupid son in-law to just f.. die! And why didn't Bobby say something?? He remembers being afraid but not that he found the dog cut open?Shitty fucking movie - stop making movies where animals get tortured to death!! Why you should NEVER cross the American dessert, or any kind of desert, from miles away from civilization!!!!  Seeing Buffalo Bill get butchered seems so out of context :p Claire from lost.
The Hobbit 	I freakin trashed my all my harry potter movies in the garbage, there is no fantasy that gets as epic as lotr. no no no I think the Lord of the rings and Hobbit movies were one of the best movies ever made Thank you Peter Jackson for taking my favorite book series and making it into two masterpieces I cannot thank you enough. I've never been more satisfied and happy with how bestifully a series has ended. Well done. cant wait for rise of mordor if you know what i mean Saur-on... Saur-off This is the best trailer ever made I love the hobbit And I love lord of the rings. Thank you Peter Jackson. This movie was just simply not very good. All of you diehard LOTR fans are just trying so desperately to recreate the feeling you had when you watched the original trilogy. This entire fucking movie is literally ONE CHAPTER of the book. And just look at the reviews if you want to understand why so many people disliked this movie. To be honest, they showed most of the actual content in the trailer, and then left the hundreds of thousands of useless CGI orcs for the actual film, and the ending result is a movie that I really wished would just end. fantastic soundtrack I was disappointed... the proportions bug me.. good movie... so close, but Dwarves are broad and strong.. doesn't add up Awesome! I can't wait for the next movie to come out! I don't get how a series can make you feel so much emotion? seru bgt coba ada lgi di tv seru bgt coba ada lgi di tv Defining mome- MOMENT???? This movie was 3 hours long Best movie of 2014 and one of the best of all time fucking garbage fagg ass movies. Middle earth has ended!           In realty it has, but within our hearts? No, no it lives as long as we live within our hearts like an expanding and an unending adventure, it is the roots of our lives it's our home it's where we belong.      I've always had a hard life but middle earth has kept me going, it motivated me to be this happy guy I am now,but knowing that it's coming to an end.......I would smile and say it fell with pride and Horner and I would be glad to fall with it. best trailer ever
Home to Stay 	Good one santosh, all the best.. Good Luck Santhosh, I wish you all the success :) Sir Best wishes for the great success of this Home Stay Keep rocking hafeeb sir this bala ..nice work sir... all the best
Hooper 	GO! GO! GO! I grew up near Pittsburgh and I remember one of my friends went to see this in the theater with his parents and he comes to school and says "Terry Bradshaw is in it and he's soo cool" --- I didnt see the movie until it aired on TV a few years later I wanted to be a stuntman after I saw this movie as a kid. I still love it! had that same shirt as a kid......Terry Bradshaw RIP James Best. great story Bill! thanks The name Sonny Hooper was a sort of in-joke... one of the best of the young stuntmen working at that time and a friend of Needham & Reynolds was Buddy Hooker. When they needed a name for the lead character of the film they just varied Buddy's name & came up with Sonny Hooper. As a further inside gag Hooper says that only two stunters could do the big stunt and one is 'Buddy Hooker' but adds that he's out of the country. But, Buddy can be seen sitting in the BG of the shot!
Hot Lead and Cold Feet Gad. The Wind in the Willows. 	till have this on vhs I heard that one of the prop pieces of the movie was then relocated to Disneyland for the queue of Big Thunder Mountain. Was Disney trying to capitalize on the success of Mel Brooks' Blazzing Saddles (Highest-grossing film of 1974)? Look for Darren McGavin (A Christmas Story) MovieTrailerMonkey got it from the DVD copy of Hot Lead and Cold Feet released in 2004!
House Calls 	Can you make a playlist in your channel  for classic movies trailers? It helps alot to me, because I buy DVD's
If Ever I See You Again 	My wife and I liked the movie for another reason. Jerry Keller (Steve Warner) is her first cousin. Two of our favorite songs are his: Here Comes Summer and If I had a Girl. Who sang the Come share my love in the video? LOVED THIS MOVIE for me...Still do...!!!...Not an Oscar Movie, but for me and my life, PERFECT...:):)!!!! Really like and enjoy. thanks again for posting this!  it means so much to me...great movie with beautiful score.  everyone with whom i've shared it just adored it too~parallels my first love and i...met in 1978 when he was 17 and i 15 in disneyland!  we've been trying ever since and i see him again in a month!  i feel like a teenager again...god bless you joe brooks for the beauty so few got to see in real life...but it emanated from you.  rest in peace.  amen. My favorite scene it's when the conductor and his friend play the piano together and this when conduct the orchestra.  Wow It's a great movie for me I remember my childhood. Bad for me that not find subtitles movie u.u in Spanish From 2 years ago, Jennifer Corley are you still around?  Not only do you share my love for this,movie, but you like horses, too. Really like this tribute especially the video portion of Come Share My Life.  Thank you for posting. Nice songs but Joe's acting was shocking...i read Shelly Hack tried to buy all existing  copies of the film..she hated it.i seen on late night tv and quite liked it..very corny as Joseph Brooks' "acting" is what killed this. He just wasn't an actor, at all, and is quite stiff and inscrutable. With an actor in the role with Ms. Hack perhaps the film would have had a chance. It was so sad how his own career ended and how his Son's life went as well. Tragic. He only composed that music for her so he could get into her panties. And it worked, too! Curse those composers! You want bad acting? This film has BAD acting. Clearly, these are liberals. Love this movie !!!!! The music is wonderful and ther story is cute. BRAVO., Dennis DOPE!! I like it! Excellent Job! Perhaps U will like my cover too :-) Great movie, I was an exchange-student in Michigan at that time, full cinema and great memories!! Thank you for sharing, Lourens wow, just wow--
In Praise of Older Women 	oh man! that moment when young Tom Berenger said 'noooo' :D, and, i just re-watched Platoon when he was motherfuckin badass Sergeant Barnes!, so this is sooo weird :D lol The trailer is like a travesty. This was robbed of an Oscar! i am in full support. hope to make a movie like that.  I was 19 when i seen this movie in 1979. after, I dated many older women in my twenties. now that i am an older man, i find myself looking at the young women...true to the movie's theme. its on dvd, remeastered just came out, the closing scene with Tom and Helen Shaver is mucho caliente... What a young man really needs is a woman of experience !!! -Time to go to school-Noooo....:)
The Initiation of Sarah 	this really isn't an "original movie," it's a remake of a movie from the early '80s with the same name and the same plot structure It's crazy how far they went with making these trailer announcers sound ever more like a fatally ill chain smoker drawing their last breaths, before they noticed that it has just become ridiculous. Around 2006 must have been the peak, when they finally noticed that the "dramatic" they were going for just turned into "bizarre". I love the original 1978 version, very sad ending however.... Is this good? About to watch this now. It look's good.  Great film! I love this!!!!! Oh Summer Glau ... The utter crap that I've sat through for you.
Interiors 	So I finally got around to seeing this film. Yes is was supposed to be bleak, but not everyone, including the men. even the scenes not in a character's perspective where cold. The acting was very stilted as were the transitions. The 535-page tax code of Singapore has more believable/realistic/entertaining dialogue than this film. Pretentious trailer. The film is a black comedy, it is totally satirical. Those fawning film critics should be shot for taking it seriously! A trailer like this would never fly today. I suppose you never "go home again", but the 70s remain my favorite decade for cinema, right down to the previews.
International Velvet 	Sir Anthony Hopkins said this was the worst movie he made.He is also in "Transformers: The Last Knight".We shall see if he changes his mind... her mother would not let her ride horses I love this film!! It's my favourite!! <3 Awesome movie.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers 	I remember going to 42st in the 70s 80s 90s and seeing all kinds of movies triple features  for 5 bucks Trailer looks great. I'm definitely going to check this. very interesting remake. It's not like modern remakes where they just tell the same story except with awful cgi. Takes the original and changes it enough that it's very unique. The sound design is also very well done Back when a guy called Donald was trying to save the world...and podcasting was something entirely different. this movie is so scary especially Donald's scary face at the end! Hi I am wondering if anyone has seen a similar movie where the body snatched humans have a creature on there back that looks like a ray? Jeff Goldblum didn't get mentioned. He was in a few movies before this one. The original 1956 movie is a lot better. A REALLY GOOD MOVIE THAT STILL HOLDS UP EVEN TODAY. morgellons chemtrails disease these are bad vegans in this movie pushwaite dindial: im a smelly paki burger and fries are up for table 5 i want to suck harry tomlinsons dick hes a 500 ;pound beast
Jaws 2 	The best of the jaws sequels!! I prefer the trailer to the film... it's much better! released on the same day as grease. Thumbs up if your looking up random things on youtube for no reason. dat HD jaws 1 ok. jaws 2 good. jaws 3 amazing. jaws 4 great. that all I actually liked Part 2 more than the original. Sorry 'bout it. Not as good as the first one,but still a good movie! OK!  I am just wondering with the lady waterskier, the shark seemed to be travelling as fast as her!  Is this really possible in real life, or is it just the movie? brody be like "im getting too old for this sh*t" Jaws: 10/10Jaws 2: 9/10Jaws 3: 1/10Jaws 4 the revenge: 5/10 This movie scared me so much when I was little. Wait what I thought it was the same one? Because one side of her face is black Awsame Jaws Trailer 1 is wsame You guy need to make clips for jaws 2 What's the black stuff on the sharks face Don't think Jaws is a legendary film at all, all it is a shark killing people and three guys trying to hunt it down...:/ Barely even view-able trailer. HD? The trailer is scarier that the moive
Jennifer 	i like  diz move this film sucked. I stuck with it to only confirm that it really sucked. I think Pratt also knows it sucked. Lawrence got 20 million, Pratt, 12 million. wt? The ending would have been better if when all the crew woke they found two or more elderly people in the forest area and asked "Who are you, you are not on our passenger list?" and they replied "I know we aren't, but you will find our parents are" (LM) who hasn't see this film yet   https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6pjak-TKeOwT2V4YmoxUU94dEU Nice movie, I think in the ending part its Jim re-awakens by his sons and Aurora is hybernating until they reach by last 2 years. Jim and Aurora hybernated after their sons learned from  Jim and alternates. Excellent movie! Jessica Lawrence is BEAUTIFUL and I don't even like skinny chicks like that. She has flaws but I would overlook them because she seems to be such a sweetheart. She's a HOTTIE. GOD BLESS her & hers! Her physical appearance in the nude is an eye pleasing shock online also. Very pretty. I wouldn't mind having to look at her every day for the rest of my life either. Cudo's to whomever her partner is.Good Catch! SUPREME PLOT. That was the most boring movie I have ever seen. i love it Im back to say its legit :D Beatifful movie Don't watch this trailer! Just watched the movie and gooooood thing I refused to watch this spoiler trailer. Why do I get the feeling I just saw 90% of the movie in the trailer. he kinda raped her. . . starlord and mystique I really loved this film, as a huge fan of science fiction and space themed films and also as a romantic person, this film moved me a lot and brought me to tears in the second half of the movie when Aurora and Jim fell in love again :') simply amazing in my opinion 10/10 GREAT MOVIE -I HAD A LONG TIME TO SEE A SPACE MOVIE WORTH SEEING!! awesome movie this movie is just  awesome to watch
Joi Baba Felunath 	Excelent work sourav  dy

Killer 	Fish Gumball: Oh, hey Darwin. Where have you been?Darwin: *covered in blood* Um... I went on vacation. What did those people use real fish if they did then the Director and Producer and Writer will be arrested for making this movie do u guys remember "Canbell holcost" from the 1980's or something like remember that everyone in the movies ran out that door after they watch that movie and the director was arrested for killing all of the actors by using real stuff and I guess this was the first found film right to the "Blair whitch project" that movie was so good and I'm really good  "Killer fish" really does that so similar to u guys because they already made movie called "piranha" and also "piranha in 3d" so why would they make movie about killer fish hello people if u guys want to see killer fish go watch piranha(original) or piranha in 3d  eny move for lee majors  I  love it  the best movie for me ever..... looks way cheesy This preview was shown back to back with "The Fish that Saved Pittsburg," likely seen in front of Superman, or Alien Ok, I'm contemplating this movie...I'm a BIG Lee Major's fan, and will watch just about anything with him in it...but I am NOT a horror fan, even the slightest thing will give me a nightmare...SO I need to know a few things...like: Does Lee die? Is he eaten by the Piranhas? Is this really scary or morbid? Again....does Lee die? this makes a difference to me..actually, I might watch if he dies...but I'm not sure...should I watch it? Paging Blue Underground to release this! I remember a lot about this mvie, mainly the music when the piranha were around underwater. that kind of casio and wailing guitar. I watched it on horror channel a few days back at 3.00pm in the afternoon and all the gruesome bits were there where the piranha eat anyone who goes for the jewels Ah, James Franciscus. When he wasn't working in television, he kept busy starring in low budget Italian shlock. I like it, too. I LOVE THIS MOVIE FROM THE DAY IT CAME TO NOW IT REMINDS ME OF GOOD OLD DAYS IN THE 1970S MAY GOD BLESS THOSE DAYS AMEN.......... Lee Majors was doing films like this by '79?! Boy,he went down faster than Elizabeth Berkeley!! why in this trailer they kept putting up the same piranha in 3 pictures @MAXIMUMGODZILLA45 lol wat if they used goldfish...... thats cool man genius
Killing Stone Movieclips Trailers 	I have to be honest here but~ is this a new movie for COD BO3?~ (XD) Yeah, But We're Working On It Though Right This movie is dope if you liked it you should also watch Spectral BORDERLANDS 2 ? Danger, Will Robinson! Danger! will...reality is that ppl will get killed while they post it...humans are viruse We need these things to kill the apes in "War of the planet of the apes" robot: Identifyme: i sexually identify as a attack helicopterrobot: *Cuts my head off resulting blood squirts everywhere* This Ladies And Gentlemen is the Result of Mixing Terminator 2 With a Little Pinch Of iRobot At once . Things don't always go Clean and stable when mixing Films together Kill Command = Alt+F4  :V I watched it. It's actually a pretty bland movie with random robotic attacks and such. To be honest I actually liked it. It was shite! Two thumbs down. That movie fuccin awesome ! Identify? why not Exterminate Exterminate Just added this to my que on Netflix, might give it a watch! so that's it huh? we're some kind of..identify for a 3 star rating on netflix, imo it needs 4 1/2, it was good. an sjw should not watch this movie Ok, we got it.

King of the Gypsies 	I found a dvd copy at the library. You can order it free anywhere in the US. this movie is bull shit angelo my love is the best its our real ppl these ppl are guyjay This is the most inaccurate of portrayal of my people and our cultural and co-culturals ever! And why are we White-washed so hard? Susan Sarandon used to be fit as fuck. In the uk gypsies are thieving bastards who can't talk properly. I remember catching the last 10 minutes of this movie on local NYC television back in the early 1980s, and I have never been able to find it again. I have searched all dollar dvd bins at Kmart, etc. no luck. Sterling Hayden's masterpiece.  someone  up load  this  movie  in full  for us  all  ?  please  thanks  I own the book and the movie...where is the soundtrack? I love the movie and the music! anyone who hasn't seen this movie should it never got much fan fare when it came out but it should have very good movie  Eric Roberts looks like Johnathan Rhys Meyer!!!;;; Incredible! In all fairness to Julia talent isn't exactly always a rewarding art and women have by nature be force to be more pragmatic less she wants to be a gold digger and who can take from her that she knows the business of being on Top. Life ain't - that's Marketing Baby - Well Eric Roberts can always be King in Our Hearts :) I agree with habitualmasticator.  He is a phenomenal actor. What happened, I don't know, but to me, he is one of a kind. A great movie. I don't understand what's weird about it, but hey, that's just your opinion. He's a better actor than his sister, life isn't fair. 1:53 Val and katie(the gagi girl) lol! I wish they had the soundtrack to this. :( @IREDEANO92 thank you, now thats more like the kind of behaviour that will save and add to this world of ours @contacter i geuss everyone likes there own kind of thing :)
Lady Oscar Grandios 	zusammengeschnittener Trailer :-D besser kann man die komplette Geschichte nicht zusammenfassen! perfekt! HINTERGRUNDMUSIK : "Acts of Courage" von X-Ray Dog. @tanjam376, die serie gibt es doch komplett und zwar auf 2 dvd boxen... Super! Super! Super!!!Danke
Laserblast 	This film is one of my favorite B-Budget films of all time. This trailer made want to watch the film! modern version similar cowboys vs aliens This trailer so ripped off Star Wars!! Haha, cheesy as fuck He shot the laser gun and blew up an entire car. But he shoots and guy point blank range and the guy does not blow up at all but just falls outside of the car while yelling. underated gem Cheesiest thing ever seen "it could blow your mind" lol To know video hell is to watch Laserblast. Those Aliens are suppose to be The Reptilians ?  LOL ! The Aquabats Super Show brought me here. In the episode The Return of The Aquabats, they had aliens they were exactly from this awful movie. Thank you, Aquabats! The son of E.T it was pretty dang boring Saw this in the theater in 1977. Only fun bit was when the kid blows up a billboard advertising Star Wars. Otherwise, I think I fell asleep for a while. this looks like the trailer of STARWARS episode 4 This doesn't actually look like the worst thing ever. At least, not after watching the Amazing Bulk review. loved it "Best movie ever made" - James Depaolo And next up in the search for the worst is..... Is this real
The Last Waltz Please Robbie...	The road has been just fine for 99 percent of the performers over the years, most of whom didn't choose to take hard drugs. Hardly the best rock film ever made, if you want to see The Band at their best see them in Festival Express Beatifully cut trailer. Sums up the whole feel of the movie. Rick Danko is freaking hot!!!!. It's cool to see Martin Scorsese so young too.This movie is a little hidden jewel:)Ohh..and I almost forgot.........LOVE4DYLAN:)
Long Journey Back 	the tv show the fbi he also told me Stephanie is efrem zimbalist from the fbi in the 60s daughter.that was so retro I watched this movie when it first aired in 78 .i was 12 years old and I watched it with my older brothers  .my late brother thought Stephanie was cool. I actually like the dad. His grieving process was different. And he never coddled her.  Coddling can cripple. I think people judged him before finishing the movie and seeing the full picture. This was a great movie! WHAT A DUMB MOVIE.........HORRIBLE ACTING yeah the movie must have just been dramatized because everyone would be running off the bus....... not staring at the train like oh nooo we are all about to die.... to u arnold u better hope u dont get punished 4 wat u said and watever negative shit u reply i could give a shit less believe me. l love our Lord Jesus and will alwayz have repect for him so shut ur trap I've had an insane crush on Katy Kurtzman ever since I saw her on Little House and Child of Glass and I still do and I'm a Grandfather. When I was 5 years old, where I grew up, a child could be placed in kindergarten or first grade. It didn't depend on a child's ability, rather the month the child was born. If the child's birthday was prior to December 21, the child would be placed in first grade. I however, regardless of my ability , was placed in kindergarten due to the mere fact that i was born in January. Therefore, I graduated at the age of 18.When I was 14 1/2 I had a complete breakdown and was in the psych. ward for 15 months. I was diagnosed with bipolar and had shock treatments, along with trying different medications until the doctors found one that works. I was unable, to feed myself, walk, talk,  use the toilet, read. I was 4'11 and weighed 70 pounds and  had to be force fed. I had to learn to walk, talk, and feed myself. I taught myself, like I did when I was 3  to read on my own. I ended up taking a week of a class in Afro Asian Studies, and a week of English . I was able to skip a grade and started 10th grade in a private boarding school. I decided to go to summer school at the end of my junior year, because I enjoyed the classes offered. I ended up graduating high school , with a 3.9 average, and not just being top of my graduating class, but having the highest GPA in the high school.I even had the opportunity to graduate 6 months early. I was offered a full scholarship to Wesley University, without taking a SAT My grades, along with my teaching an English class in my high school, as well as being a Resident Assistant were the reasons I received my scholarship. In addition, my 2 teachers, along with my guidance counselor, wrote letters on my behalf. Due to my adoptive father walking out, just a few months prior, I decided it would be best to stay and go to a local college.I graduated with an associates degree with a GPA of a 3.85. I ended up meeting someone whom became my husband and had 2 children. I met him almost 29 years ago and my daughter is 16 1/2 and is going into the 12th grade and my son is 15 and is going into the 10th grade. I am divorced from my first husband and will be getting remarried ( God willing in less than 2 weeks). Due to my health I am disabled, however I am an ordained non denominational minister, who uses social media to reach out to anyone regardless of one's faith, or even lack of if they need it. In another words, i am an online friend to anyone who wants or needs to have one. I am very thankful that  the Lord of my understanding , helped me heal, so I could offer encouragement, and hope to anyone who is looking for it. This is so terrible ): I wonder if it happened it seconds because if it took 30 seconds to get off the bus and get to safety.. so this must have happened sudden, I highly doubt people wouldnt think to run off the buss as fast as possible if they saw it coming. Great movie. chloe trains, always a damn chloe train, i hate chloe trains great movie sad happy and a bit tearful and a wonderful ending i loved it thank you for sharing it.:} "Look, Celia. You don't have that foot". "Now it doesn't have to hurt anymore". This is a line that I will start crying at as I keep watching this movie. So awful for any parent to have to say to a child and for the child to have to process and deal with. I don't think the dad was being a jerk. He had wrong ideas about being a husband, father and a man and this made it more difficult to deal with the tragic accident. I guess it's only school busses who have to stop completely, opening the window and door to listen for a train. The city bus never seems to even when they do stop all the way (which is rare here) it freaks me out. I live literally 25 feet from the train tracks here in my town (I live in norcal) How could any father say maybe she would be better off dead! Great movie
The Lord of the Rings 	2017, 16 years on, and this is still my favourite film franchise of all time. this cant be the official trailer 1:21 Where is that from?? It's not in the movie? Who's watching this in 2017? They had a shot of the Uraki army from the two towers. They waned to make it look even more epic I guess Frodo and Sam, greatest gay story ever. Nice. I hope they make it into a book or something. WHOs Watching in 2017? :) I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I can go around and Avoid being seen as I wish!-Aragon I do not need a audience! The important thing to take away from this film is...One does not simply... *Who's watching this in 201.. Oh wait. It really doesn't matter. Oh well. One does not simply spawn an incredibly viral internet meme. Somehow wanted to watch this trailer in 2017 :) Does anyone know what song starts at 1:49 mark? who's watching this in 2017? Back when trailers wee actually good

Love and the Midnight Auto Supply 	I wish I could see more for free.They did the barn scene when the pigs got out at my house,where I still live..I was jst a kid but I ncan say this that girl that played annie was fine! I have a hard time beliveing that her fist movie was in 56?If I had to guess I wouldnt have thought she was alive yet in 56,but I guess she agfed very well.. My grandfather was the sheriff at the courthouse that get kicked in the nuts by a girl. I don't know exactly why he got the role, but I know they needed a sheriff for the scene and who else better to play a sheriff then a real sheriff.  LOVED THAT MOVIE seen it in 1979 surprised it was only PG would have thought it R . How timely for our times...
Magic 	wie heisst der Film Best movie I've ever seen I swear I know how the 7 of diamonds trick work... slow it down to 0.25. At the beginning of the trick, it went too fast, when he did it again, the beginning didn't slow down or speed up. It just tricked you into actually focusing. Then towards the end you see there are more than 1 7 of diamonds.Like he said in the beginning by the time you see the trick it's already gone. This is in fact true, your eyes see before your brain, you are not seeing the present, you're seeing the past. I think it takes like milliseconds for your brain to process what your eyes see, that's why by the time you focus and try to pick a card, your brain falls behind and to make up for that, the cards have tons of 7 of diamonds. I Love Atlas This opening is so great!!! Love this movie!!! 2:23  That time when you realize John Turturro screwed you the magic trick!!! It's scary to know that she almost, actually died making that sence I know a lot of the "tricks" in this movie are total bullshit.. but that doesn't change the fact that this movie is really fun This show is like Jay Chou meeting Harry Potter, Lex Luthor, Hulk and Alfred Pennyworth right? u know why u picked 7 diamonds? Because there was more than one  7 diamonds cards in that deck. Put in in slow motion at 0.25 speed and u can see clearly. U cant remember one card when he  shuffle that fast, but when many comes in a row, u can. It cant be more obvious Music at 7 diamonds? shit i picked 7 diamonds Best movie ever! Seriously Lex Luthor that's weird I saw seven too In the first who's doing the card trick i picked one and its 7 of diamond i think i know the trick its easy How are people so amazed by what he did in 0:24. It's one of the basic card forcing technique. There is a trillion tutorial videos of it on YouTube. It's the 7 of diamonds because they slow it down, sorry WTF I SAW 7 OF DIAMONDS TOO
Malibu Beach 	Absolutely adore this movie! Such a time capsule of an era I was born too late to enjoy :( you can get the DVD in a multiple movie set for a great price with other movies in this same category. I worked at a drive-in movie theater as a teenager and this was one of many films of its kind to play while I was there. This movie really "inspired" the couples who came in to see it. It was many a night I had to knock on van doors and trucks at 2am and kindly ask people to leave so we could close up. There was probably a small town population explosion that resulted from this playing. Never forget walking around the lot during the show, making sure everything was cool, being distracted by all those hot women up there on the huge screen. Very, very memorable. LOL. That guy scurrying after seeing that fin was funny. or hell phones !! Oh the grovy 70's such a carefree time. This must have been made for the Saturday night drive-in fun times. wow, 1978, no tattoos on these girls... Awesome film.  Great time piece into the 70s. Passiert hoffentlich im Film mehr als im Trailer?
The Man in the Santa Claus Suit Huh. 	This must be before the +John Viener we all know today became a writer, since he was born in the same decade this film came out. How festive. :)Edit: Silly me. Casey, God rest his soul, was talking about actor John Byner. I thought it sounded like he said "Viener" at first. One of my fav Christmas movies. Living proof on why NBC was dead last! Why doesn't any channel carry this at Christmas?!  I've asked several channels to put it on but none of them every do! I've seen it for sale on Amazon but it's like $50! Don't have that kind of cash!  Eight rolls!? WOW! That was pretty impressive of Fred Astaire, considering the fact that he was 80 years old. This fist aired on Sunday December 23 1979. The last time I saw it on TV was ten or twelve years ago. It used to be part of the Family Chanels "25 Days of Christmas" rotation. I got lucky and taped its last showing. Is tihs something I shold try and find to post? Fred Astire played eight roles in this movie. The Costume Shop Proprietor, Chauffeur, Policeman, Cab Driver, Jeweler, Floor Walker, Choral Director & Santa Claus What 7 roles did Fred Astaire play. What day in 1979 did this air? When was the last time this aired on tv? Why hasn't this excellent movie been released on DVD?  It's a classic! I've seen this movie, its pretty good. A feel good Christmas film. I've seen this movie. It's pretty bad. Fred Astaire in 7 roles? I bet it's better than his 1 role as mailman S.D. Kruger in the Rankin-Bass animated holiday classic "Santa Claus is Comin' To Town".
The Manitou 	Saw it at the cinema and very nearly went to the boc office to demand my money back it was that bad. Obviously Tony Curtis must have been very desperate for money at the time. Rifftrax just did "Day of the Animals" which was also directed by William Girdler. Of course, Syrian born Michael Ansara got typecast playing the Native American... yet again. Here's hoping the Rifftrax crew sends up this cheesy stinkfest sometime soon! The Manitou- Starring Tommy Wiseau yay, that type of thing us it...ha ha My mom saw this when it first came out and made my dad move their mattress into the living room (multiple exits). When I saw this, all I could think was "awww, it's a midget Manitou. cute" dale like si estas aqui por dross :v In 1981 I was preg t and by myself when this came on and it scared the crap out of me! I was 26 years old and had to call my mother to come over and turn the television off. There was no remote control! Problems with the Manitou?  Bring in Radu Molasar ("The Keep" 1983) or Roddy McDowall's "Golem" ("IT" 1966).  Sure, the Manitou can kick Imhotep's ass, but not those others. Love this film, Masterton is the forgotten heroes of pulp horror. This was based on an early book by Graham Masterton. I think it was his third novel. I read the book before I ever saw the movie play on TV. I thought the book was pretty cool. I was disappointed in the film. The special effects were bad and it was hard to tell what was going on if you hadn't read the book. William Girdler was in over his head on this one. Grizzly is a much better film (and, yes, it is affectionately called PAWS by those of us who remember JAWS and the cultural upheaval it caused). Most people don't know that there was a paperback sequel called Return of The Manitou. In that one, Misquamamous came back and brought 22 other deceased medicine men with him. They possessed a school bus full of kids (I don't remember why) and Singing Rock got killed in that story. the full movie used to be on youtube until youtube deleted it Dross :v xD Dross XD. Vine por mi dios dross :0  Queria comentar en ingles para que no piensen que vine x dross, pero no se ingles :v Los que vienen por Dross son maricos. Ese dross es un loquillo LIKE SI ESTAS AQUI POR DROSS dross What was the line...when the world is connected by wires...?
Martin 	Are you kidding me or Are you kidding me - Best bit. The trailer does not do this film justice Does anyone have this cover of all along the watchtower as in this trailer want a business]? create one here https://storage.cloud.google.com/onllinebusiness/e-commerce.html This film is one of the worst examples of mankind, were the life of a single person is more important than that of millions of children who could be saved with the costs of that rescue. Is the worst story one can think of for a movie. Totally wrong GREAT MOVIE... My teacher made me watch this for homework. Best teacher ever hahaa Cood!!!Welcome to KF KF ART - We present  the high Art of modernity - Revolution in graphic arts! Be the first earthlings, touching to miracle!

The movie reminded me of that movie where Tom hanks was stranded on that island in the ocean I can't remember what it's called but there is similarities Ghost 1990: July 13, 1990/July 13, 2016 Thank you FOX 20th Century for believing in a project that means everything to me and my family, friends and loved ones, you did a great job, my tears are a great comfort to me, and this project comforted me greatly, Thank you NASA for all you have done for me and my family, I hope anything I have provided to you has in the same measure been an equal benefit to my Sisters and Brother Astronoughts, I love you to, Thank you to all my Thespian Sis., Bros ,and Crew-members who made this project possible, I love you to, Matt you nailed and I 'am honored to have you do IT!!, peace and love, Doug.
Mean Dog Blues 	Kay Lenz, George Kennedy and Gregg Henry - I am so THERE! Love their work. umm... Bing Crosby Productions produced the movie.  The Director, as is pointed out above, was Mel Stuart.  Did you forget your glasses? ;-) I can't believe that Bing Crosby directed this movie. Kay Lenz was a GODDESS in the 1970's. I love George Kennedy Is there a scene in this film where Kay Lenz gives head to the lead actor? I think I caught a portion of this movie one late night, but I can't be sure. All I remember was Kay (at least I think it was Kay) kneeling down to give a BJ and outside of the room they were in there was a rain storm. Is that this film or am I totally off? YES! Classic!

Midnight Express 	Oh Billy... Turkish are a cancer this film is so underrated Possibly in the top 10 john hurt performances! Aww poor drug smuggler Simply Brilliant Brad davis died on aids...He get real gay in Turkish prison...But it s allways better dan guantanomo bay RIP Sir John Hurt :( Now THAt my friends is a trailer. I wish i could have seen this trailer in 1978. magnificent Alan Parker directed film. this must have been the average score of 8.7/10, great story but very true. great film! Turkey is the most peaceful country in the world...but it seems jewish and armenians dont miss any chance!!! in the book of this story everything was mispresented and this movie also dramatized the book...Director of the movie apologized from Turkey at his visit to here....the country movie takes place is not even Turrkey,its Malta...most of the actors are greeks,armenians and italiens...one of silly jewish prpaganda on muslim societies... THIS MOVIE WAS SHOTED BY JEWS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE HATENESS TO ARAB PEOPLE IN GENERAL.  THE STORY IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE AND BE AWARE OF SOMETHING, MY FRIEND, WHAT  HE CARRIED UNDER HIS T-SHIRT WAS NOT ONLY HASHISH.  AND TELL ME ONE THING: HOW CAN AN AMERICAN BOY  TRAVEL TO ESTAMBUL, GET AND ENORMEOUS QUATITY  OF DRUGS  (ACCORDING TO THE MOVIE) AND THEN MAGICALY BECAMES A VICTIM WHEN THE POLICE CATCH HIM AND MOREOVER A HERO WHEN HE ESCAPES FROM PRISON.  IF TURKS LEFT HIM GO HOME FOR A BIG MONEY, YOU'LL SAY THAT TURKS ARE "FUCKING CORRUPTS.  THEN, WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM AND YOU SAY FUCKING TURKS. AND  PAY ATTENTION BECUASE AS YOU REMARK THE FRASE IN THE TRIAL: "YOU'RE ALL PIGS"  i SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THERE WAS NOT  MORE ANTISEMITIC SCENE IN CINEMA HISTORY THAT THE ONE YOU REPEAT.  WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS HAPEN WITH THE MOVIE IF BILLY WOUL HAVE SAID:  YOU'RE ALL PIGS" BUT IN ISRAEL?????    FUCKING INHUMAN BRUTAL ISRALITES.  THEY HAVE NO JUSTICE. FREE PALESTINE!!!!!! This is nothing more than a tear jerker dressed up as movie "saying something" so people can kid themselves they're seeing something serious. fucking Turks.i like what Billy said just before his sentence." YOU'RE ALL PIGS"FUCKING inhuman brutal Turks . they have NO Justice.
Les Miserables 	Can't you see this guy is the wolverine! The cast of this movie full of so many legends, one of the best casts for a film in a long time, there's so many big names. this movie is one of the best movie ever and that every one should watch this film, this the best films and musicals i have ever watched 10/10 trailer.5/10 movie. I'm one of the biggest fans of Les Mis ever. Like, ever ever! But the movie just didn't quite cut it for me. The 'singers' were largely disappointing (except for Hugh Jackman and Samantha Barks). "Truth is given by God to us all in our time, in our turn." they can at least speak with a slight french accent There's an almost comical moment at the end where Javert is walking away from Valjean and he hears a gun go off behind him. The way they cut that in the trailer is just hilarious. One of the most beautiful trailer This is my favorite movie tbh what an amazing cast this muiscal phenomenon Wait...Newt Scamander? Watch this while listening to TSO's Overture from their "Beethoven's Last Night" album. It's almost perfect! I went to the movie theater expecting a nice, fairly sad  musical and left a sobbing mess I REALLY LOVED THIS FILM! <3:-D The choice of music fits aboslutely perfectly in this trailer! It gave me goosebumps, especially the change from javert's part to one day more and then the epilogue. I cried. Was this released fairly early? Only the film looks totally different to most of the shots seen here. Also, one shots are not even in the film. the book was one of the best books i've ever read . i read it in french , and it is sad that it is not as touching in english as it is in french , for those who can read french i advise u to read it , it's maybe long but it is worth it
Moment by Moment 	Cringeworthy and amazing.. two nearly identical gay actors  essentially getting it on with themselves ..:)) This is so disturbing... they legitimately look like brother and sister. I love Lily but this is awful! Two men in a hot tub, SEXY!!!! Moment by Moment turned out to be....Nothing by Nothing It's time to take chances, make mistakes, get messy! She said Strip and he's like,I already have my clothes off..duhhh..... I think I heard the hot tub screaming. Ah...Those special GOLDEN moments..........oh dear. Honest to god, why would they cast two people who looked so ridiculously alike?  Lily Tomlin is hot! Mrs. Kotter, are you trying to seduce me? Yup. It's still as terrible as I remembered.
Animal House 	That Dean reminds me one of my deans in college. But nothing bad happened to him. We did wish that he would resign. Later he finally did but became mayor later. ugh. miss the classics they dont make them like that anymore One more killjoy for ya: This film's humor's been ruined for me by real-life Bluto-behavior leading to the death of John Belushi at age 32. "Louie Louie" was the perfect song to express the vibe of "Animal House", but why set the story in '62? Why not '64?, when this version of "Louie Louie" actually came out. Poetic license is ok, but it would've been easy enough to get it right. "It's time for someone to put their foot down; and that foot - is me" This is not in HD. I was a teenager when this came out, started a whole tradition of toga parties, that kept us stoned and drunk into our mid 20s, great times, and love the fact the film doesn't cop out at the end, there is no redemption or them knuckling down and it turning out all right in the end, they are a complete bunch of screw-ups till the final credits roll! Make it six. I am greek but this movie paints a negative picture of fraternity. everything is faked by hollywood!! I watched this movie to prepare myself for college  You copied that joke off another version of this trailer. You ruined the joke I remmember watching this with the old man two years ago when I was 17, he gave me a very sarcastic don't let this happen to you at university look. good times 2 people are out. Finished at Youtube. Expelled. I want you off this website at 9:00 Monday morning! not sure if srs but thats Louie Louie by The Kingsmen :P
The New Adventures of Heidi 	Wow. Ghey. I remeber seeing this when i was very VERY young. Newsfront Was Great on opening night Night Cries zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Nightmare in Blood 	Could U post the full movie? Please, it's been a long time now that I wanna watch it. Thanks =)
The Norseman 	The six million dollar man goes Viking lol! il ne manque plus qu'un viking chinois un viking black, on aura tout vu avec ces  kh onn ards de yankee a black viking lmao! Charles B Pierce?  The guy who made Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues? Also starring Deacon Jones, along with Shaquida, Shaneequa, Shenaynay, Luquita, Lupita and Jeenaa. Vikings never whore horned  helms It is written in the Sagas that Norse leaders sported 1970s porno mustaches. It's funny how Hollywood really adopted the horned helmets look. The horned helmets...DYING! Hark, a vagrant brought me here. hornhelmets and norway? *facepalm* Leif Eriksson and a small group of followers (about 30 crew if I remember correctly) landed in North America less than a generation after Greenland was settled under the leadership of Erik the Red. While the Greenlanders were ethnically Scandinavian Norse, they weren't "Vikings" in the proper sense. They were simply farmers looking for new land, and possibly timber resources, as Greenland has none to speak of. As for the African slave called Thrall, played by Deason Jones, the name "Thrall" simply means 'slave'. And as a slave, it would be unlikely for him to be acting as a warrior. He'd have to have been freed from bondage first. Also, while it wouldn't have been so common an occurrence, slaves of such diverse origins would have existed in Scandinavia during the Viking Age. The Oseberg ship burial in Norway contained the remains of two women. And the younger of the two, believed to have been a servant to the older woman, belonged to the mitochondrial haplogroup U7, which is more commonly found in regions adjacent to Iran. And the Vikings did travel as far east as the Caspian Sea via the Volga River and as far as North Africa as well. So how would it turn out if they had a ninja buddhist viking from Vinland Saga manga. Hahaha, this is the purest form of excrement. I like this movie !!! Next, we could make a terrible remake with pewdiepie, Robbaz, and various swedish/dane/norweigian/ icelanders guys (including Notch). "A lusty horde of blonde giants and this one black guy they found somewhere or other," We discovered the americas ffs, the vikings went all over the place. Yeah!!! Lee Majors!! WOO HOO!! :) my thoughts exactly!! that's why I'm gonna watch!!
Oliver's Story 	Crazy movie. Just crazy. He should have gotten with the girl his friends hooked him up with. She had brown hair, and was an artist, like Jenny. Seeing Ryan and Candice together was like watching two men onscreen. That junk was not right... the level of masculinity coming of off Candice. And, she was so wooden. Ryan's prettier than Candice.
The One and Only 	"You're My Everything", sung by Lee Min Ho by himself. What's the song starting at 0:22 called? lol what whos the chick there? You just tricked us with award wining Lee Min Ho. where isit? Nicely done! Whatever LMH does is always great. And yeah thanks to Toyota to choose LMH as the best Korean actor. Frankly, I really want to have Toyota Camry. Haha Uuuh. Lee Minho... I'm not sure I understand this commercial. SARANGHAEYO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 sarang-hamnida It means i love you in korean  Just because of Lee Min Ho I want to by a Camery for my first car!I soooo love Min Ho! I think I want a Toyota Camry now. hahaha! oh my gosh. I'm so in love with Min-Ho Lee. :)  Racist :) I want this car now ! Sexy Min Ho !!! =) The Camry will prove it LOL XD  Gu Jun Pyo (Lee Min Ho) brought me here :)
One in a Million 	Curry Kareem would merk this guy eyes closed I hope he makes it to the NBA he have to do alot of hard  work to become a legend. his body is not fit like currey or james like players we are Indians love our country
The Clonus Horror 	is this what happened to Colonel Steve Austin............... Wait. Wasn't The Island a remake of this? 0:55 this scene looks just like the one out of the Sixth day with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The clones in bags, but in the sixth day they were under water Anyone know where to find this full movie? There's one version on YT that I have seen, and it has a terrible russian voice-over :P 2:33 and! this video end!... any one have the full movie to upload please?a douchebag has uploaded the full movie but has ruined it with his cocky reviewing voice  Actually its just called "The Fall of the Roman Empire" from 1964. Hope I don't come across as a dick lol. Oh, we have a real hipster here. CLASSIC....fuck those unfunny dumbfucks at MST3K. ....and fuck Michael Bay too. I'm glad the makers of "Clonus" sued the makers of "The Island", showed 1000 points of similarity between the two movies and won an out of court settlement...I wish the makers of "The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire" sued the makers of "Gladiator"...its almost a carbon copy... Great movie, remember it well. 1000 times better than the big budget corporate snoozefest "The Island" that ripped it off. Wouldn't that be great. Two Chester B. Kelly's walking around. Johnny thought that he had enough problems with the "Phantom" Now this? @GhostManBrandonDDpre Sci-Fi + Nightmare?  I kinda like "Sci-Ni", hehe omg i had no idea till now that richard on here was chet in emergency!!! Where science and nightmare merge... would that be a sci-mare?and you liver and your kidneys and your eyes and the food in you refrigerator. I recognize Tim Donnelly. He used to play Chet on "Emergency!" This is one of his post-"Emergency!" roles. The island was a horrible movie, I screamed in horror, but horror of disappointment. The story of this film has been reworked (+/- stolen) for the movie "The Island"
Patrick 	Damn Patrick interrupting Brian and Kathy's sex scene (even if it was just a dream). this must be a remake of the one from 78... Never even heard of this remake... Is that Tywin Lannister?? Some people thought he was crazy, He appeared to be deaf, dumb and blind, None of them knew of the sixth sense: The power of PATRICK'S mind! So... where's Eliza? Such an underrated movie. Found a movie I'm willing to watch because the trailer doesnt reveal a lot and has a new plot you don't usually see. And 5% cuz that Patrick guy is fetching. He is supah Hot Evil Awakens? Seems like The Evil Within... This full movie is on YouTube now...original as well. "Im not yours patrick i never will be!" then why were you kissing the boy for? What is Patrick's real name in real life someone plz tell me he is solo hotttt Tywin you bastard! I think the original movie was better... Just watched it. Nuts math (that means cool for the folks). Really twisting and suspenseful. I wanna see this  Tywin/Numspa you scum sucking sonofabitch.
Petey 	Wheatstraw Tyler the creator sent me heat in that interview That's what we call my supervisor No business born, rat soup eating son of a bitch!!! so damn funny! rated R mother fucker! Love me some Rudy Ray Moore! This and Human Tornado are classics for this time period. I had the opportunity to meet and take a photo with him about a year or so before he passed away- he had a great attitude and enjoyed talking with fans.... RIP Rudy Ray "Dolemite" Moore Just purchased the movie on DVD at target for less than $10, no cost for shipping and handling (not a bad deal to me). One of my favorite movies from my childhood. I can remember when my cousins and I would sneak and watch this movie as kids lol. TYLLLEEERRR!!!!!!! I just purchased "Petey Wheatstraw-The Devil's Son-in-Law" on DVD from Amazon.com for a very low price. The DVD's are also on www.deepdiscount.com Petey wheatstraw was the funniest movie i ever saw i wish. I could see it fully on you tube Can someone please upload the full movies of petey wheatstraw and uptown Saturday night  Mad as a Hornet in a Bumble Bee eye! Tyler the Creators fear bought me here Cx Amazing.. My life is complete. ...I have the DVD to this, might upload the movie since it's not up on Youtube. Rudy made another movie called the Disco Godfather, that I also have lying around somewhere. Out of them all, I love Petey Wheatstraw - this shit was just mind blowing, the dialogue and acting is hilarious (my favorite scene is the nightclub at Leroy and Skillet's place, the band does a terrible job at pretending to play the instruments ROFL), and overall the story isn't too bad. And it had Kung-Fu! Tyler was scared Great job! Talk about some weird shit RIP Rudy Ray Moore
Piranha 	hey This looks like a parody movie Katelyn Snow? Really? name of song at 0:7 ???/anyone knows ?please reply back they should not have made a second movie bc its pathetic double the stupidity 1985Marty: Doc!Doc Brown: What is it Marty?Marty: I NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE!!Doc Brown: What about it Marty?Marty: Piranhas and dumb sluts everywhere!!Doc Brown: Marty don't be ridiculous!2012Doc Brown: Where did I go wrong??? ik ben 2 jaxserf outf theirs zombies and piranhas wow omg lol bring meh my legs xD danielle panabaker is so hot double the D's Hell no!!

Planet of Dinosaurs 	Is this one of those "all the best bits" trailers I wonder. Let's get out of here lol Well, the special effects look pretty damn amazing...the spider like thing (maybe just a giant spider) really looks cool & creepy old school this is fake 0:57 makes me wana watch the movie now.    =D The Lost World look at the crazy face in the rock formation around 1. 24:19 Hey what's with the song from Jurassic park?! Greatest fx ever... I love that last line. Did no one else think of that? Was it just like; "Yeah, why dont we get out of here? Great idea Gary.". Wow! John Williams' AWESOME music is way too epic for this low budget film... Is that the monster from 20 or 30 thousand factums Go to Vasquez Rocks, you gotta expect this kind of thing. epic 1:41-1:45, Best dinosaur legs ever Epic movie must have watched it 10 times when I was a kid! Wow.... This Music is "The Hunt" from The Lost World Jurassic Park II... great!! Not really an extraterrestrial world... but marvellous dinosaurs and creepy spider ! I like it for an older Dinosaur movie about how man kind find a livable planet with Dinosaurs. I think they should reboot this maybe.
The President's Mistress 	Don't tease us like this! Where's the rest of the movie!
Pretty Baby 	This film could not be made today.  Like not even close. eeeew the fuck people before and after is not de same.so don't packing judge it. Beautiful movie wtf This movie's trailer makes this movie look twisted as fuck...and I'm sure that it is, reading up on it. Trailers fucking sucked back then. The trailer claims that this is Brooke Shields film debut, but she was in "Alice, Sweet Alice" two years before.
A Question of Guilt 	Amazing performance by Tuesday Weld she should have won an Emmy for it.  Esp the scene where she takes off her wig and makeup...riveting you can't take your eyes off of her. This is based on a true story of Alice crimmins case anyone know where I can watch this
A Question of Love 	Its a shame grindr came up to lgbt community to ruin the hope of love and not just sex and looks Just finished watching the movie. Absolutely loved it. French cinema another time proves that they know how to do sophisticated, realistic movie. 10 out of 10. :( Watch also latter days...one of the best.. pretty Great Film! This JAQOL, Shelter, BBM and No Regrets (korean). :] The movie was OK, not much of a story but the acting was good and convincing.   It didn't hurt that the two leads were very good looking but that doesn't make a movie great.    I would recommend it though. Its a great film.Right up there with shelter. @crisengineer yes indeed, I remember the first time it came on TV in France, it was huge, because such a topic had never been treated in such a positive light on French TV before.
Rabbit Test 	Joan Rivers was funny (and herself) in this film trailer for a film she herself directed called "Rabbit Test", which starred Billy Crystal. Rest in Peace, Joan. You will be missed.  Why, Billy Crystal? THIS WAS A VERY FUNNY MOVIE!!!!!!! I SEEN IT WHEN I WAS A KID!!!!!! Billy Crystal looks like a cute teen in it!!!LOL!!! Is there ANYWAY! i can see this movie?, i dont care if its funny or not i just want to see it!! :D Funny movie ! I have a movie poster of this up in my house.... Where can I watch this movie? I would like to see it. I really want to see this! Can someone upload it for me? Joan's best movie she directed  was THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO with Stockard Channing. someone download this movie? That looks awesome! SHE TALKS THE SAME, WALKS THE SAME, acts the same but i don't if she looks the same. lolwe love you joan!
Remember My Name Breaking Bad. 	<3 A MASTER PIECE. No words. Respecto to Bryan Cranston Awesome trailer I watched it when it came out but I forgot the comment great jobb!! This video is absolutely amazing! phenomenal job!
Return Engagement 	this movie was so bad lmao pls dont even waste your time like i did i have only read about 50 books with this storyline...Still i cant resist clishes Kelsey Impicciche from Buzzfeed is in this movie!!! 1:12 bruh she looked just the same as she always does, I don't understand why there's always a scene like this in romance movies they're pointless. You're telling me that he suddenly noticed her beauty because she wore a different shade of lipstick and a longer dress. smh. The narrator sounds like a Barbie movie narration. btw movie looks cheesy and cliche but i love that stuff so i wanna watch this And all of a sudden we saw the whole movie! pfff Looks so cheesy but cute so I was gonna watch it anyways but kind of sad  they spoiled the whole movie in the trailer :/ How Do I get to watch these movies?? I thought I watched SNL trailer again. its just me or all the actuel trailers spolies allot! like they just make the movie smaller ! sawing this i dont need to go and watch the movie now! great!!! ><" something about how the black woman was portrayed rubbed me the wrong way...... i can't explain it noel holy shit AT THE END HE DIES! SPOILER ALERT! I might have maybe taken this movie seriously if not for the music. lol it just told the whole story O_O ...I thought this was a SNL skit...

Return from Witch Mountain 	Davis blame so many years Warner Bross' studio for manking hr do horrible films and then she did this film many year after all that drama.What was she thinking? What a pitty how  did the mad scientist and his assistant manage to get  tony on the operating table and put wires on him which are connected to machines When I was a kid everyone wanted to be their friend LOL it's a riot Return from which mountain? Why are you using your powers against me? Seriously, don't do that!Okay?  Escape was great, but I never saw Return... Wasn't there a third movie called "Nuke Witch Mountain To Hell And Back!"? Wow! Kim and Kyle Richards had both acted opposite the Legendary Bette Davis in two Walt Disney classics, Return to Witch Mountain and Watcher in the Woods! I think that is soooo cool...! Lol I had a crush on the guy in this when I was a kid LOL i first saw the 95' remake and liked it a lot. then i got to see the original thanks to my parents and i liked that one even more, but the most recent remake was a disappointment; i didn't get it. @DokiDokiMorning I have the Special Edition DVD from 2003. A new Special Edition was released in 2009. The Easter egg has either been removed or moved. I don't have the 2009 edition. @NatashaMontana back then, i liked this film and the first one. what sucked for me about this movie, they always talked to Tony through the control box thing that controls the mind control unit behind his ear. why can't they just talk to him directly without holding it up to their faces. This is a superb book that was made into two equally dumb movies. What a shame and a waste of time and money film has gone to shit now, if you wanna watch good films, go no further than the mid 90's i cant believe i just accidentaly ran into this, i was looking for this movie! i remember watching this wen i was little, had it on cassette. The new one sucks compared to this one! Dude, that's not cool. I've never heard of you and my sister probably hasn't either. I love Kim Richards!!! pure classic!
Revenge of the Pink Panther 	It is missing. Ot was stolen. By whom? A thief. Not Now Cato. You little yellow swine. Not Now!!! Inspector Clouseau teaming up with Cato Where the narrator voice
Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry 	My class is reading the book right now what is the book about? I'm in finna Cramer Jr. high readin this Me and my 4th period class(I'm in middle school) are going to watch this movie on Friday. My ELA class just finished reading it. Told myself I wasn't going to cry at the end of the book.. Reading this book for class Rockin. Rockin and roll of thunder. Down from vickburg I'm strollin. With the wallaces, shot me in the head, not fun! I was wallaces, hmm, stop it now. PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW I read this book when I was maybe seven years old. It still gets to me. It also led to my sister and I trying to create a washout hole in the middle of a nearby dirt road. Didn't work, but it was one fun messy day! isn't cassie 9 years old TJ DIES I am in Durant road middle 6th grade reading this bookk Thems Wallaces iz bad peoples. On last chapter, good book but the end is sad Am I the only one who imagined Mr.Morrison as the ''Suprise mothafucka'' guy from dexter ? That dude badass Dang, ruined the whole book for me.Psych! I read ahead of my class and finished it in less than a day (the day i read ahead) I just finished the book today. I must watch this movie! Im reading the book right now Just read the book, really good u should read it
Romeo & Juliet 	The story of Romeo and Juliet is so deep and powerful even knowing the ending makes you cry. the 1968 version is better Why in every Romeo and Juilet movie does Romeo look like Zach Efron? Also this trailer makes it look a lot more romantic and dramatic then it actually felt like to me when reading it I hated Romeo and Juliet in my freshamn year, but i will watch this version for douglas booth and my chuck bass 14 year olds having sex.. wth is this I'm about to vomit.. I've always wondered, Juliet's father threatened to throw her out into the streets if she didn't marry Paris. Why not let herself get thrown out of the house and then sneak away to mantua to be with Romeo, I mean, if she was going to essentially be homeless anyways? It kinda baffled me when I read the play for the first time in class that that was never even considered an option. That seems like a much less complicated alternative to taking the sleeping potion, and we all know how that turned out lmao. But I'll try not to question Shakespeare's genius---I still love the play and all of the adaptions <3 *Y O U A R E A S A U C Y B O Y* Anyone else realize they messed up? Capulet is supposed to be red and yellow colors but they switched it...It just bugs me There is so much awkward kissing in this movie lmao dam Juliet could sit on this dick any day why was the trailer better than the actual movie... There's two types of people in the world: those that love Romeo and Juliet just to say they love it, and those that hate Romeo and Juliet just to say they hate it. that 'hactress' is so superficial, she's transparent... I don't see her. Maybe a defense mechanism, to not go blind or scratch my eyeballs out... Fuck, I can't stand her... she's ruins all the films! ...don't get me started on that Moretz twat...What was wrong with Lily James? so many other fairy-tale beauties... not these superfece(all)s 'ragtresses' My only love grew from my first hate, seen too soon, known too late. -Best quote. Yup. Lovely. I am dead inside. Thanks Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, not a romance, get it right. Fun fact.....Hailee (Juliet) wasn't even born when Romeo and Juliet 1996 released
Ruby and Oswald 	why did tippit have to die before they could say of kennedy was dead. why did they leave out the blk ladys testimony??? she said she was short and bigger than oswald and what happened to the guy they thought was oswald that they arrested first? looked just like oswald robert somthing they let him right go Heh, I remember watching this as a kid. This film scrupulously follows eyewitness testimony, just as it claims to do. You may believe that this testimony was corrupted by the Warren Commission, or that the eyewitnesses themselves were corrupt and/or mistaken, but this film does not take liberties with sworn eyewitness testimony. This is in marked contrast to Oliver Stone's film JFK, in which he literally made stuff up for the sake of making an exciting movie that would be successful at the box-office. What a load of shit ruby was pressured into killing Oswald he cared nothing for Kennedy it was kill or be killed. Did jack ruby kill Oswald because he loved president JFK and was distraught??? what a crock of lies this movie was / is Oswald you have a really cute daughter Ruby was a no good rotten shadowy figure in the Dallas underworld, but he did spare Jackie Kennedy from having to go through a trial.   I give him props for that. anyone that believes this horseshit lives in a fantasy land filled with candy and sugar filled streets Love JFK Not a bad "docu-drama", anyway, my opinion is that all this "conspiracy industry" is just that a fast way to make a buck.  If you take the time to read the testimony of the Warren Commission, you will come to the same conclusion; Jack Ruby was the kind of glad hander and guy who couldn't keep a secret for anymore than two minutes.  He was a local character who had no ties to organized crime.  He did have constant problems with the American Guild of Variety Artists which some say was a "mobbed up" union.  As to Oswald, he was a failure who simply wanted a place in history.  I sincerely doubt that he held any malice at all against the President, just wanted a footnote in history. Good to see Doris Roberts. Glad Ruby killed Oswald.... Sad movie too, but true of course. I wasn't born when all this happened, but I know there was a President Kennedy. This movie sucked they portrayed Jack Ruby as a person in morning for the president and his family. He was there to silence oswald he was part of the conspiracy Excellent movie. Almost exactly as it happened. Back and to the left.......evidence. Connally turns around to look when JFK is shot in the neck.......evidence. Many witnesses believed a shot came from the grassy knoll.......evidence, that was refused by the Warren Report. Parkland Hospital surgeons said blowout to the back of the head.......evidence, that was refused by the Warren Report.A massive cover-up by LBJ and J.Edgar........ evidence. Many witnesses directly or indirectly involved were murdered....evidence. Eg: Johnny Roselli started to talk in the 70's and was to give evidence and was killed the day before.....evidence. Motive for an assassination was abound everywhere by the, Federal Bank, Oil magnates, LBJ, J.Edgar Hoover, CIA, Mafia, Communist haters and a more that I can't think of at the moment........ALL EVIDENCE. Did Jack Ruby really love JFK that much?? It was odd he only shot him once in the gut....since this was so crucial for the coverup, killing Oswald that is. That's is a point against conspiracy. One shot to the torso. Oswald could have easily lived. So in your description you say u believe Oswald killed JFK? So you believe he acted alone? this is a damn Good Movie !!!
Sasquatch 	we reviewed this film for my local film fest review class and good god this film was The Room of Bigfoot films it was that bad but so good at the same time. I watched it last night. It's shit. Wow, you can really tell when a movie is extremely low budget. I simply can't wait. acting was too horrible I couldn't get passed 25% of the film, probably best bigfoot film so far is Willow Creek and Exist ppfffttt.. boring Bigfoot is actually real MORE  LOW BUDGET  WARMED OVER CRAP ABOUT A FUCKING BIGFOOT..........................................................................THE 73 MOVIE ....FROGS .......WAS BETTER AND IT HAD SAM ELLIOTT Just from the watching that stupid ass trailer, I hope every last one of those dumb white trailer parks hicks die miserably in the film. Gonna pass on this what looks like a piece of shit. Oh dear.. Harry and his crew have turned to the darkside LOL As soon as the guy yelled HELP ME I had to take it off .. Ahh,to bad,at least the title is decent. low budget Bigfoot movie. do you agree? OHMYGOD!!!SUCH SCARY!!! just watched it, had high hopes for it but it was horrible. Shame too as it had potential. But the miner story did actually happen in real life. Story Plot;  a son and father,  after enduring a horrific family tragedy... strain to cope with life's new challenges and domestic difficulties... the son finding it ever-more difficult in attempting to reach his troubled, distant father who has insultated himself from everyone around him, after the devastating loss of his wife.   the two make valiant efforts to start a new life living in the woods,  and rebuilding everything they lost.  this is a peek into the complex relationships between a father and son, when faced with the unimaginable.  so they endeavor to repair their troubled and distant kinship.  'oh yeah... and some giant hairy chewbacca thing,  menaces everyone in the film.   "but the real story is about"..... etc    Ha ha ha!
The Sea Gypsies 	I finally got to see the film tonight - LOVED it! Thanks! What is the name of the dubstep song during the storm in the movie ? WOW, real guts! A fantastic adventure. Loved the last quote. Thanks for sharing. Holy crap. This made my heart pump Nico, just saw this at Mountainfilm and it was top of the list with my family of four. So fantastic! That is gonna be the best documentary ever! i can wait to see it up and to share it with my world! thanks Nico for this marvellous account of what is Infinity expedition, the "home away from home". check it out! I mean, there are always adventures on the go with Googlehttp://www.infinityexpedition.org/making-ready-for-north-west-passage/ Awesome footage. Can't believe you don't more views. How do you manage to keep the camera so stable? aw shit, this is fuckin sick, really looking forward to the full documentary
Semi-Tough 	I'm guessing this is like...bull durham? I had cramps in my left leg and went to a "massage therapist" Ouch! I got Pelfed to the Nth degree. But it did solve the problem. I loved this movie.
The Seniors 	vry nice film..enik valareyadikam ishtapettu..biju manonum manoj k jayanum thakarthittund...comedy seenukal adipoli........cinema iniyum kandittillathavar  ethrayum pettannu poyi kanuka...adipoli suspens chithram...ini aduthengum iithu poloru padam irangumennu thonnunnilla...........
September 30, 1955 	Sure wish someone would post the whole flick
Sergeant Matlovich vs. the U.S. Air Force 	Wow so glad I just bought this movie on 16MM film on eBay for $49.95. Great outside summer view on the big screen. Thanks for sharing the trailer!
Sextette 	what a looker for 85 years old.... one of the forgotten gems of Hollywood.  Mae's last film? Nothing says "sexy" more than a ghastly 80 year old woman, lol. I love her.  I do.  One of my idols.  However.... that they allowed this film to be made was a shame.  It just comes off as an old woman trying desperately hard to recall her youth. How did THIS get made? She was a Leo with Moon in Cancer & Taurus Ascendant Seems I recall reading how West try to seduce everyone in the set and actually had pretty good luck. Guess it was a chance to experience the legend. simply adorableRIP mae This had a star studded cast. How did I miss this.. Can't get over that she was 85 here, she looks like 50 to me, she must have sucked a few souls to look this young at 85 She was fucking 85 years old and looked oddly young, she must have been an alien Mae West was an incredible person and 100 years ahead of her time in her thinking and attitude towards human sexuality both straight and gay. She also pretty much invented the sexual innuendo which has become such a common part of our everyday conversations. She looked great here at age 85! So pretty Simply the best. But what do yall know looks terrible Who was taking care of her at this age that they'd exploit her like this? She was clearly almost senile. So camp .. Mae was the best! Best Zombie movie ever. Keith Moon & Alice Cooper !!!
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts 	Club Band Hearing The Bee Gees singing the Beatles is awesome! I love this movie. the only thing I'd remove is the ending medley. Campy, silly fun....loved it at the theatre & still do.... I enjoyed this movie when it first came out but I was very young.Where it went wrong was not so much the plot but the lack of dialog . A musical without dialog is boring even with beatles music.Interesting in thinking now this kinda exposed the evil in high places in the music industry . Unpopular opinion: making a musical based on the Bearlrs isn't in and of itself a bad idea. Neither is making the movie with the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton - they were actually very talented musicians if not actors. Where they went wrong was transplanting a "story" (if you can SP a coherent story) about quintessentially 1960s English whimsy to America in the 1970s. What was campy fun in 60s Britain becomes corny nonsense in the 70s USA. Sometimes I feel like the only person in the world who actually likes this movie. When the movie originally played in theaters,  there was a mega mixx of all the songs used in the movie that played throughout the end credits.  It ended with the piano slamm  just as in the original Beatles version of "A Day In The Life".   But the home video versions changed that,  replacing it with part of "A Day In The Life"  and then switching to the Sgt. Pepper song for the remainder of the credits.   If this movie ever gets a Blu-ray treatment,  hopefully the original ending music will be restored to the credits complete with the piano slamm at the very end.

There is not way they could make a movie like this again! All the bands would want too much money!! this movie made me think peter frampton, and the bee gees were the beatles, fuck my life 1:09 'nuff said Only one logical explanation:They were all doing mountains of cocaine. As corny as it is I love this movie! One of the many sins for which cocaine must someday answer... "The 70'a, The Motion Picture." From what I've read, he apparently saw it as an in-flight movie, and described it as "hell on earth" to sit through (even though he and George allegedly helped bankroll some of it!). OMG,the ONLY REASON I'd even BOTHER to WATCH THIS,is seeing Steve Martin SING in this!!! OMG,that is just EPIC!!!
The Shout 	Some of the score for this film was done by Tony Banks and Michael Rutherford of Genesis. A MASTERPIECE by MAESTRO : SKOLIMOWSKI The scene of the man with the shout standing on the sand bank mid-shout! and the sheep falling beneath him freaked me out when I was a young teen, in a really weird way no other movie really has, and well remembered for it :) What a fantastic British film. Loved it!! I saw this film on Australian TV late one night and was glued to the screen. A really weird and interesting film. I like the way the announcer just had to take a dig at "The Exorcist" and "Omen" in the narration. Like the X-Man Banshee. Absolutely excellent movie 0:58 - "Alan Bates is Crossly, master of primitive man's deepest secrets..."So, does that make him Master Bates? Top 10. The trailer is a little silly. They sure do give away a lot. If you've never seen it, wait about 1 month or so until your memory is real vague and fuzzy of what you've just seen. Incredible movie. Deeply disturbing. Dovakin's grandfather? Have you seen Liquid Sky? It's not horror or sci-fi or of any genre, really, but it is Art. There's no other film like it.     "The Guard" brought me here. I love arthouse horror, only have seen Antichrist and Possession though. The premiss to this movie is ludicrous but, I wanted to see this movie because, I'm putting together a 100 best of list for horror films and I wanted to see if this movie is worth putting on there. Does anyone think this is worthy of being on a 100 best list for horror films? @glgioia  - they have it for sale on ebay! Great film, but its nowhere to be found. Netflix doesn't acknowledge its existence. Help! Waaw, this is a great movie, nice pictures!  i didn't like this movie :(
Ski Lift to Death 	A little tip : when your horror movie has only three characters in it, don't spoil which ones die in the trailer. Well this movie is better then disney frozen I REMEMBER TYPING IN "FROZEN MOVIE" AND IT WOULD COME UP WITH THIS, NOT THE SHITTY DISNEY BULLSHIT!COPYRIGHT! is that bobby from x men? if he's power is ice and snow then why did he died here in this movie? I find it difficult to believe how the girl survived two nights with no food or water and in freezing temperatures!? 1:32 PAUSE RIGHT AWAY AND LOOK AT HIS LEGSif you've seen it you know what it looks like when he breaks his legs. :0= If you listen really carefully you can hear the wolves sing "let it go" while he hangs from the lift.  It's all Bobby's fault! UGH WHY DID THE CUTE GUY JUMP HE JUMPED DOWN WITH FREAKING STRAIT LEGS AND SHE FELL ASLEEP WITH HER HAND ON THE BER THESE PEOPLE R IDIOTS AHH Just jump off... BRILLIANT effing movie! I mean, I've seen hundreds upon hundreds of horrors and thrillers and this one is one of the most INTENSE movies I've seen. Not to mention the movie writers and director made it realistic, it's one of those movies where the characters either try to do everything, or can't do anything you may think of to try to escape the situation. Hard to watch. Love it.Side note; that scream during the trailer at 0:55 is so hack and cringe-worthy. this is the worse movie ever. holly crap. the guy who made this is a fucking retard 1:40Leggo and this is why im never going on another chairlift. What I piece of shit Frozen will do for chairlifts what Dreamcatcher did for toilets! Which is fail horribly at making them scary and look hilariously stupid while trying. I haven't seen this movie yet but would anyone on here agree this is a lot like the "Open Water" films????? I remember the day that Disney were going to release a movie called 'Frozen', I truly thought that it was an animated comedy version of this film, because the Disney' Frozen trailer I saw showed the scene were Anna, Krisof and olfa falling into the snow. I thought that was a parody of the dude who fell down on the snow in this film.
Spawn of the Slithis 	Slithis needs cataracts surgery.  How can he support such bad eye sight through 89 minutes? Wow, a 1978 monster movie with 1960's cars in it. gillman and slithus can shrug off bullets and shells, but the monster squad gillman cant handle it My uncle was the Slithis. Unfortunately passed this year, at the time they were making this movie my uncle was an Olympic hopeful and was the only person they found who could swim with the slithis outfit on. I finally got this song DVD and I have to say this is the cheesiest movie from the seventies next to tentacles it's funny you'd be better off drinking and watching it because it's not very scary and I can't believe that they put this crap out but hey it made money and it's still making money My step father helped write the screen play for this movie. this is so fucking kool Guess I don't need to watch it now. slithis? 1:04 is that Jay from half in the bag? Very grindhousey, with visual pops, streaks, and a blue-band (?) trailer approval, not to mention the survival kit.Some scenes look like they were shot through contact lenses, until I figured that was the monster's lizard-like clear second eyelid. Clever. I want a Slithis survival kit! Who'd win in a fight; Slithis or a Humanoid (from the Deep)? I saw this movie today. I really liked it. It is like the older stories in comic books. vata 22 was here
Slow Dancing in the Big City 	I remember one review of the film.  It said "the shameless climax will fry your brain cells" (critic Leonard Maltin) whatever that means! Could you upload the whole movie, please?  We'd really appreciate it! :) coming to 40 years ago when i watched this one summer.  one not forgotten film of my life. Small titts..but very cute! This is coming on tomorrow (3-29-15) at 12:15 pm on MGM Channel. Somebody should record it because it is only on tv every 5 years or so and has never been released on vhs or dvd. I would like to see more of Anne ditchburn scenes from this movie and coming out alive, six weeks. I am very intrigued by her beautiful  face unbelievably gorgeous she's so under rated.  The greatest ballet film ever made along with the turning point The score is the best part of this film. I wish you could upload the whole film.  You must have a 16mm print or something.  I know it's corny but I would buy it if a DVD was offered. The greatest movie that was ever made.Paul's speach toward the end was priceless.I cry every time i see this movie.Someone actually fell in love with their heart. Hey Anne ditchburn was in the slasher flick Curtains (1983). She was a ballerina but she was killed :( although I don't think she had any lines... Even though she lasted pretty long. Thank you. I  i have an original vhs tape in the factory case...bought it on ebay ten years ago. i'll sell it for a serious buyer. loved paul sorvino in it, and anne ditchburn was nominated for a golden globe for it do you have any more clips?! Thank you......! Thank you, thank you, thank you....this is one of my favorite movies of all time...especially the music.  You don't happen to know if Samuel Barber Adagio for Strings is one of the songs.Thank you. I just watched this movie, love the dialogue. I can see a remake! where can I find the sound track? @diddymuck: No way! Are you kidding me? I've been looking for this movie for what seems like forever! No wonder I could never find it... =\
Someone's Watching Me! 	I reallly want to see thiis film., I cant find it anywhere "Someone's watching me." ""What does he look like?" "He's tall, wearing dirty blue coveralls and has a pasty white complexion." Thanks for posting.  Casey Kasam and John Carpenter. Halloween was released a month before this, though I think Carpenter shot this first. its very good nothing like the promo  Saw this as a kid and it scared the bejeezuz out of me! Recently watched it again and it really is a classic thriller! :) Back then, it wasn't promoted as 'horror'; I watched it then as a made-for-television thriller.  @EddieAldaFor 70s horror, this looks bad, but it was actually directed by john carpenter (Halloween, Christine, and the fog)  who won multiple awards for suspense in this film. I almost confused this classic with Are You Alone In The House? which was made the same year, that one was a crap-fest, now I gotta see the Carpenter gem.. This is an awesome movie. P.s. Shaggy is the man!
Spider-Man Strikes Back 	I saw this when I was 5,thought it was great,now it's so bad it's good,love the I'll fitting suit. Now look this movie should be released on DVD from Shout factory! They had so stylish movies back in the 70's :) AWESOME!!! I remember that!
Steel Cowboy 	Hard man on a tranny! Lol! First week?! Lol Get pulled over these days, and act like you are ordering some food infront of a cop, You would be pulled out of your seat, beat up, locked up.. Maybe back in those days someone can joke like that to a cop. Not these days.... Good movie.. I can't find this song anywhere.... wow. astro and white western ! how can i download this movie !? Tearing ass...give me a 12V92 TTDH with yellow injectors and I will show you how to pull the kingpin off of that bitch!!! better screw your ass to the seat son cause were going to pour the propane to this bitch and straighten some curves and flatten some hills!!! it appears to me that the slow moving 335 cummins astro set him up. black semi having a brownie he forgot how fast he can fly it appears to me that the slow moving 335 cummins astro set him up. black semi having a brownie he forgot how fast he can fly Damn, that Astro was hauling ass a mack is the way to truck Whats the name of this song? Anyone knows the song?? =) Rip Torn!!! dir auch mein freud
Stingray 	My Father in law made this movie ,it is totally awesome Been wantin to see this since viewing the trailer on vol 2 of 42nd Street Forever, looks like a fun movie. Man, this trailer has better quality than the DVD of the movie that's circulating around!! I really hope this sees an official release!
Stony Island 	8-miles before 8-miles I love this movie.  Missed both screenings (LA, Chicago) and turned to Hulu.  I was 3 or 4 when this was made.  This is the Chicago I remember - though a Southwest-sider.  Davis is highly underrated as a director.  His fingerprints are all over this and most of his action films too.  Songs in this film are amazing.  Almost perfect film 3/4 of the way.  Glad I finally got to see it. Saw this movie back in 1978..was thrilled it was filmed in chicago Wonderful movie! I really enjoyed it. Recommending to my friends. Anybody who has tried to get a band started back in the day can identify with this story. Just saw this tonight with Alejo Povada. Wonderful film, and the gig at Buddy Guy's after with the Chicago Catz was killing!!!!!!
Straight Time 	not sure he said Dustin Hoffman enough times... If Dustin Hoffman looked liked this still,he'd of been interesting as Tony Stark in the 'Iron Man' movies. ....Watched it at our local movie theater when it first came out in 1978! Movie Theater was packed out, back in those long ago hazy days things were so uncomplicated, like filling out your tax return form etc. Gone are those lovely days. Wait a minute, no computers though, i like today's times....lol. Is Dustin Hoffman in this? And what is the movie title? (Yes, this is sarcasm.) You can watch it for FREE at PrimeWire-dot-AG.  Awesome site. Go check Amazon.com, it's there Dustin Hoffman Maybe TCM is different in Europe.  It figures you guys in Europe would get all the good movies! LOL! Kris, I check the TCM schedule every day and it wasn't on this week.  Was it another network you saw it on? Actually, it came out a year earlier, so it would have been up against The Deer Hunter. Why is this movie so hard to find???  It's never on TV, it's not on Netflix, and it's nearly impossible to find a DVD of it!!! I sense some subliminal messages in there. Undoubtedly the most overlooked film of the 1970s. This trailer would love for us to believe that this is a comedy film Such a great flick His best performance. Brilliant. Theresa Russell and Straight Time @shlabotnikj   What an authentic and beautiful scene that was, just beautiful!!!
Stunt Rock 	I am a huge movie buff, even I had not heard of this until I went poster shopping last month. Found this poster at the bottom of the box. I had to have it! He punched a dog in the face. I begged my parents to take me to see this at the drive-in.  Nope. Spinal Tap had a prequel??!? This movie is beyond amazing, do whatever you can to see it. ASK THE WIZARD https://www.ioffer.com/i/614850148 AWESOMENESS parts of this remind me of the Leo Wanker character from the Paul Hogan show lol Nitro Circus with more explosions and a wizard. The textbook definition of awesome. why is the guy at 2:00 fighting a big cat? Beavis and Butthead just fainted. Have this on DVD.Definitely worth...having on DVD. Saw the trailer for this at my buddy's independent DVD shop, The Lobby. Definitely have to get my hands on a copy! I sent myself here...not some celebrity. I'm that Super Music, Super Magic and Super Amazing.  like if green brought you here Impressive farting at 2:07 1:59.. is he battling a liger?! This movie is fucking badass!!  I dont know if "LIKE" is the proper term but it's pretty badass just like a Honey Badger
Summer of My German Soldier 	Sharon is so adorable!!! my phone posted twice sorry I watched this movie when I was 12 years old in junior high the same year it aired in my history class.i was very moved by this story I watched this movie when I was 12 years old in junior high the same year it aired in my history class.i was very moved by this story Kristy McNichol, a fine actress in her own right was fortunate enough to have worked with two of the very finest: Esther Rolle and Sada Thompson.  Both were dignified and graceful artists. Esther Rolle won her Emmy Award during the last five minutes of this film. By the Way... It's Summer OF... you putz! I remember this from my childhood, it was sad and depressing. I thought of how she would have to live out her life, probably never married or accepted because of it.  We all see this through her eyes, but imagine if we were those people, really, what would we think and feel. Maybe some of them lost sons and daughters (nurses died in the war, too) to the Nazi, then learn that an American kid was protecting one of them.  I liked to think she moved to another country when she was older or converted and became a nun - at least then, at least within her convent, she would be forgiven. The Germans have a version of this movie. It may even be called the Summer of my American Soldier. I will have to check title. But true! Trivia 7 years old when this came out, never seen it but I'm about to!!!!! The cook is cute. "Hitler people killed her" Classic line. This was such a wonderful and touching movie it brought many memories from my own experience of my own life. The world we live in is a mean, cruel world but we might live in but we dnt have to be part of it. All those who have have miss treated human life's due to color raise disability have laughed first but The Holy Bible says they will and shell laugh last. When Christ comes back those will be judged for there own actions That's it Michael Constantine, spank her, spank her hard!  Spank the lesbianism out of her! Her father was an asshole and needed psychological help. Seriously something terribly wrong with him. Her mother was an idiot too. I cried when Anton was told dead Telling his daughter that she is dead to him.  How more evil can he get? at 1.25:03 & at 1.26:1  when he says " I knew you hated me" oh contrar it he who hated her because she looked like her grandmother.
Superman 	this movie was so underrated zac snyder directed watchmen and 300 which are very dark, violent and somewhat sad stories. zac snyder shouldn't have directed superman which should have been a hopeful, fun and lighthearted film but instead was a very dark, violent and sad movie.  He could have made a batman film as the tone of that character fits well with zac snyders film making.  Someone like Speilberg should have made this superman movie. this movie gets better n better in each viewing I really want a #manofsteel2 #manofsteel2 please Good writing: "Mom! Mom! Clark pushed the bus out of the water!"                          "Is that so, honey? Well maybe if you'd eat your vegetables you could have helped." Bad writing: The boring, unimaginative, literal way this stupid movie deals with it. Yea he kills zod, because you know he totally wanted to, and like omg what a shit movie.... no this film is amazing "He'll be an outcast. They'll kill him!""How? He will be a god to them." Love this line. Wish he was real <3 Those damned french horns... the best Superman movie ever .... i wish they bring back to live in justice league The music my god haha if only the movie was half of a reputation that the trailer present. Hans Zimmer you're amazing I can't wait for superman to return in justice league. In my opinion the film is rubbish, but this trailer is one of the most epic works ever made It's a shame this trailer was 10 times better than the movie. The trailer is way more coherent than the movie Its 2017 & still it gives me goosebumps Say what you will about the final product, but this trailer is one of the best works of art of the 21st century. Period. this trailer still gives me goose bumps, and this movie is epic idk why ppl are so harsh with this movie
The Swarm 1 	Bee was harmed in the making of this movie.... a very melodramatic trailer... with a lot of big name actors... typical 70's disaster movie that was in vogue at the time... I haven't seen this since I was 9 or 10... cheesy then, still is... Where did the bees come from Just nuke the god dang bees I think it's safe to say that Wu-Tang Clan's video for "Triumph" was largely based on this film. I had no idea that if you lean on a couple of buttons a nuclear plant explodes like a balloon filled with gasoline. Just spray them. Katharine Ross was so hot. (This movie is shit). When Hillary gets elected the swarm will attack every happenis alive uhh how high you think you they were when writing this script .... little alone the tralier narration lol.Rifftrax and the new MST3K show should hit this baby. The voice over trying to sound like Rod Serling. I remember being so scared as a kid of killer bees and how they were going to kill everyone.. Thanks to this movie. Then, while living in Panama when my father was stationed there, our school go attacked by killer bees when the pest control people screwed up and cause  them to go crazy. we were stuck in the school for 2 hours... Is this what The Swarm at Thorpe Park based on? Defenitely more interesting than zombies or nukes. If were going to make apocalyptic movies I want them to be more unique. A STORY OF COURAGE....AND SACRIFICE. This is one of my favorite bad movies. This movie has to be seen in its extended version. If nothing else, for Caine and Widmark's discussion on the bees' penchant for eating plastic which adopts the William Shatner School of Inappropriate Pausing. Yep. Gotta love a way over-blown disaster that can easily be remedied by a can of bug-spray. The plot is sort of similar to the tv film "It Happened At Lakewood Manor", except instead of bees their were ants! Looks hilarious!
Sweeney 2 	Very underrated film. Disappointed by the poor execution of that dropped ceiling. The bank really should make a claim against the contractors who fitted it. "John Thaaaaar". Love it. x Looks awesome of course. Bought the series as soon as available region 1, countless viewings. No luck with the movies though. PAL dvd players don't like me either. Keep trying for my all time fave. Goes off the rails at the end, but the first half-hour is cracking. Very good film, quite violent for 1978.  Certificate X!! I haven't seen the second one yet, but here it looks small fry compared to the first.  First had a cop conspiracy, you think they'd raise the stakes in the second, have terrorists or something. A fucking awful flop. The stories with blaggers always seemed to work best in the series and do again here. Nobody told me he was armed and dangerous!! TOTAL QUALITY TITS!  God Save the SeX PiSTOls one thing i have to say quality Spot on trailer for a spot on film.  Awesome. Thanks for uploading the trailer! I watched the movie again last night for the first time in years and had forgotten how brilliant it is. A very different tone to "The Profumo Affair" influenced first big-screen outing, but a cracker nonetheless. Mind you, bearing in mind that it was written by Troy Kennedy Martin, how could it not be?
Thank God It's Friday 	"The definitive disco flick?"  Saturday Night Fever says 'hi'. XD Fun Fact  - The blonde lady in this clip posed nude for the February 1977 issue of Penthouse Magazine at the age of 16 and those pics are easily available on the internet. :)Could you imagine the disaster that would be caused if she somehow sang an Academy Award winning song? My faver show ... not a trailer
The Thirty-Nine Steps 	Controversial version? Yes. My all time favorite version? Absolutely! GO HITCHCOCK! Haven't seen this one seen the other two on the bbc! Have'nt seen this version An excellent version with a terrifing climax! My fav version :) hehe maybe cos I like Powell ^^ Cracking version. Proper boys own stuff. GOOD film ! This was a shocker of a film and a disgrace to John Buchan's memory and a travesty when compared to  Hitchcock's masterpiece.
Ilsa the Tigress of Siberia 	How many of these movies did they make
The Toolbox Murders 	This one Sucked. 0 One of my favorite Chanel's Seen this on the el rey network the other night. They show some pretty rad movies on that channel also had new york ripper and lucio fulci zombie on the same night badass. this is a bad moive Whoa
The Bermuda Triangle 	2012 , jurney to the center of the earth and another else guys? it's so fucking fake that is only for inter10ment... this was just a bunch of movies and youtube videos striped together, plus it did the hunger games whitsleing thing, OF COURSE ITS FAKE @Jeff Torsorio I just noticed that it was journey 2 COPYRIGHT!!!!!

Uchu 	kara no messeji this should have been star wars episode 7 And then there was Star Wars that topped everything. a Japanese Roger Corman type of movie One of the better Star Wars rip-offs. To be honest, I think this movie is a cheesy copy of Star Wars. I must be the only person who unironically loves everything about this movie. What a hot steaming turd So it's a "phantasmagoria"?I took a huge phantasmagoria this morning and it looked a lot like Message From Space. It is hard to believe this was released after Star Wars. Sankuokai... I cant even watch the trailer, let alone the movie. I actually like this better than Star Wars, believe or not. Check your Walnuts!!!! I just watched this and gods.......words cannot describe how awful this film is ....it just hurt .....so much ...there's great B-grade sci-fi and then there's .........Message from Space....>< "Never before has the screen erupted with so much excitement." As if they don't remember Star Wars which came out in 1977. juajuajuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa The director of Battle Royale and the creator of Kamen Rider, Cyborg 009, Kikaider, Super Sentai, etc., working together! Great music here but theme of movie is not interesting to me. It was made in Japan that is why the music is better. Wann gibt es denn Film auf DVD?
Uncle Joe Shannon 	I drove 20 miles in an ice storm at 16 years old with some buddies to see this flick what a waste but I've got the LP its better than the movie that was awful I can't believe that got made Bert young was terrible they should have used mf Listen guys, why are you making fun of Bert.  Really not that bad.  BUT!!!! the guy conducting... wow, bad bad bad!  I think if I'm seeing right the horn Burt Young is holding (note I didn't say playing!) is a Holton MF Horn. The mouthpiece is definitely a Jet-Tone. I guess if he can't play, at least he's holding the right equipment! Its hard to watch,  you could pull ANYONE off the street and teach him to "fake" the trumpet better than Paulie............  but great to "listen" to....... There will never be another Maynard!!! Bert was great in the movie, but his trumpet faking was so...FAKE! There will never be another Maynard!!! Burt Young could have done better, that was the worst impression of a high note trumpet player ever, at least with andy garcia he tried, the song was good and maynard sounded amazing Very Nice, Maynard Ferguson continues to be one of my favorite trumpet players!!! MUY BUENO!!!
An Unmarried Woman 	What was the point of the daughter mentioning she'd "chipped in" for a classmate's abortion? That didn't seem to me to fit in anywhere - very much came out of the blue. Erica: You wanna see other women?Saul: Do you want to see other men?Erica: Not today.Saul should have called it quits there. The seventies were brutal _"I've only slept with one man for the past 17 years"_ Sounds depressing as fuck. And vice versa too, I'm sure. But we need marriage in order for our ridiculous puritan society to function. Fuck it all. I was always a fan.Great actress. I miss Jill Clayburg. Before "Sex and the City", there was "An Unmarried Woman."" +Rene Skeptic in connection to the thread from earlier today, I thought you might like to watch this trailer. Where are you, beautiful lady? No offense to Jill Clayburgh, but her character is also a cold castigating fish who uses sex as a reward. sorry I though she was diane keaton  and how could I possibly forget the gorgeous Alan Bates...rest in peace always Loved this movie....so sad to hear of Paul Mazursky's passing...a wonderful director...both he and Jill Clayburgh gone too soon.. Alan Bates was very tasty back then I must say! RIP Paul Mazursky R.I.P. Paul Mazursky and Jill Clayburgh... great actress.
Watership Down 	you sTUPID *BUnniES* this has to be one of the saddest, nerve breaking, bloody kids movie i have seen. this is the worst movie I watched this when I was a kid and got half traumatised This is so sad and scary You know..Kids! In Memory of Sir John Hurt, Richard Adams great job boys were going to fame if this sells out (never sales) all ways refunds money gon down to 1$ I was always suspicious of that Narrator's voice.. first part: looks prettywhen narrator basically says I'm wrong:........ im surprisd not that many alltime10s comments perfect cartoon to play for your 4 year olds I like it when he said unusual film Along with felidae and plague dogs these are terrifying movies what's the name of the song that's plays after a bunny gets shot not for kid's
A Wedding 	Andie Mcdowell is so beautiful!!! Why is this film so popular? It's not funny or romantic. None of the characters are likeable - especially Andie MacDowell's character. Why would Hugh Grant's character fall in love with that ice maiden? I would watch this film 1000 times and not get bored if it wasn't for the very very boring female character! Love this film hugh grant at his best .. Hilarious movie that captured British wit so brilliantly but the last scene in the rain was pure Hollywood shite. Oh, Hugh! <3 ok I'm just here thinking of love actually (same song, same actors) :D adorable Why is it that when I saw Mr. Bean do the whole wedding ceremony, I expected him to say "Mawwiage. Mawwiage is what bwings us togethew today ..." from The Princess Bride. I love this film Mr. Bean! Lol how was hugh grant so fucking beautiful??? he and his adorable glasses are killing me cant stand rom-coms mr bean is so funny! hahahaha Mr. Bean!!!!!
Who'll Stop the Rain 	Yep this movie needs to be uploaded - especially now. nick nolte was bad ass in this movie
The Wild Geese 	I love this film but damn this trailer gives away too much! The intro of this was unforgettable... That music. THE inspiration for me to become a paratrooper.  My 11-year-old self locked onto those maroon berets and never let go.  Truly love this (err...less than perfect) film.  Oddly enough, it changed my life.  Yaneverknow... Why does Cardinal Jose Luis Tagle Prudence Learn from His Police Arm DIVINE MERCY! wtf kind of trailer was that??. well, i guess it does save me 2 hours and 9 minutes. I just occurred to me that the narrator for this trailer is also the one for The Day of the Jackal's trailer. Jesus, I thought modern trailers were bad about giving away the ending. The good old days when the good guys carried FN's I love Mercenary movies. Come to think of it,this movie maybe the first to show the Uzi sub-machinegun in cinema action.The 1980s showed the uzi in films(like "The Terminator")and if this movie was '78,than it's the very 1st. That is the thing with al these old movies they tell you the whole movie either way it's a great movie very sad but action packed. Trailer show the whole damn movie!! CAPTURE AND RECAPTURE KSK KMD FOR REAL THERE I basically saw the whole movie in this preview. =] Still worth the download and watch. Such a classic I remember a similar movie with David Niven and Peck and Moore was in that also I think. Random fact: Theres a 70s Kung Fu flick that borrows the music from this movie. screenplay by reginald rose, who also wrote the classic " 12 Angry Men." I was going to send this to my friend to interest him but it would ruin the whole fucking thing!
Wild and Wooly 	uuuuuu i bought the game because of this Who sucks at go fetch the most? Poochy or Yoshi? Yoshi is so cute Vaca lola huuh I Love Yoshi ! :D Paw Patrol , 99pll this is like a worse kirby's epic yarn 071 B,.", vghhh.  ..loiuyy Z [[ ZZ Happy
The Wiz 	I hate that this movie flopped, but I am glad it has attained cult classic status. I remember watching this in Elementary in music class I was like 7 see you on blu ray in april I love the wiz with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson and everyone in my favorite movie It's Always Sunny brought me here !! I love Michael in this movie, he is so cute!!! I saw Nostalgia Critic review this. The wiz will always be better than the wizard of oz. Great effects was this M.J  "FIRST & ONLY"  movie does anybody know? Orange is the new black brought me here OITNB The trailer is Classic. All around just a Brilliant Film. That will carry for eons,especially since most of the entire Star Studded cast has passed away Now this movie called The Wiz is bombed in the box office! So I was thinking "Man, this looks terrible and nightmarish (from about :49 to 1:31). Who designed this?". Then I got to 3:19, and I was like, "Oh." This one was so racist looking back on it now. stupid fucking movie. let's take some more classic movies and ruin them. racist ass movie.
Zero to Sixty 	it needed Mater from Cars...and of course, KITT...where's KITT We got Back to The Future there, but we don't got Death Race 2000. What a shame. Nice trailer You forgot...Cannonball RunSmoky and the BanditSteve McQueen's Bullittand American Graffiti TAXI french version??? No Born 2 Race? Good car movie  Nice mash-up but incomplete to my eye...Where the hell is Gone in Sixty Seconds (shares the word Sixty as in title), the classic Bullitt and the unforgettable Nice chase in Ronin..? Bullitt? Gone in 60 seconds? Vanishing Point? No Drive?? Disappointed... What about the general lee? ;( Where Mr. Bean whit Cooper and sofa? LOL  For a video called zero to sixty and yet you don't put Gone in Sixty Seconds? You put Transformers, which wasn't even a racing movie, and you don't put Need For Speed?? Ridiculous.  Erm.... need for speed?  death race <3 KIDZ....What the car wasn't invented till 1980?... Bullitt, American Graffiti and Smokey and the Bandit... Just to name a few No Need For Speed? Disappointed... rip Paul Walker.....
Zuma Beach 	I wanna see this movie so bad :( ...and justice for all. The most ridiculous court film that I have ever seen. Pacino's portrayal and the script were asinine. before al pachino adopted that deeper voice. Mmm pretty good trailer, nicely edited. But I don't really like showing the "you're out of order'" bit because that's the highlight of the movie and best left unspoiled lmao i have to watch this Hold it! Hold it! I've just completed my opening statement!   such an underrated movie !! Am I the only one who thought of this when I saw the senate debates that lead to the shutdown?! pas de probleme'Go to Hell ! This is such an awesome, awesome movie. Watched it for the first time, and I'll be perfectly honest, my heart was racing through the 2nd hour of this movie and I was on the verge of crying at some points. Two and a half men brought me here. I love Pacino's performance in this movie.Especially the ending scene. So epic. you are wrong of reply this is the music from Back to the Future  This can sounds stupid but i came for Metallica's Song.... and justice for Al .... ah ah ah OMG HETALIA!!!!! "This whole trial is outa order!!" 10 moneypigs, please let us watch a 30 year old movie without continuing to pay for your pedotorturist lifestyle///on behalf of the victims of your war on the poor, children, and the decent She's a Goddess. And Dudley Moore is soooooooo funny When I first saw this trailer on TV and saw Bo in the car with her wedding gown on, my jaw dropped. She was amazing. The most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. She was indeed an "11". great video
1941 	Was it really that hazy? It seems as though people either love this movie or hate it. This STILL IS one of the FUNNIEST MOVIES I have ever seen!!...and it flopped at the box office. America needs an enema! :-/ heheheheheheheheeeeeeeeee!! Wow, the trailer was badI blame the trailer as guilty of the box office.The film is good This movie is CRAZY...I love it. I thought it was a great movie enjoy Great movie, great trailer! I didn't know Steven Speilberg directed a comedy! columbia help universal to make this movie in 1979 Universal Pictures And Columbia Pictures Present An A-Team Production Of A Steven Spielberg Film 1941 0:31 lololol Saw it when I was 13 years old and LOVED IT!!!Dianne Kay was so the bomb to me one of my favorite films This was one of the most disappointing movies I ever saw. In a unfitting epilogue, the self-hating, anti-American historians James Loewen (Lies My Teacher Told Me) and his more famous co-Marxist Howard Zinn (Peoples History of the US) cite this anachronistic piece of garbage as evidence of 1940's-era American xenophobia and racism, rather than dismissing it as the failed remake of Animal House it actually was. Today, it is required viewing in revisionist history classes and, for them and their young charges, who are de-lighted this lesson involves no reading, has become the Gone With the Wind anti-American WWII movie. Pass the bong, comrade. Wasn't this movie made by Spielberg to debunk the "Battle of Los Angles" UFO sighting in February 25, 1942. There was a lot of artillery firing at something that faithful night with over 1400 shells spent. Six people died that night from unrelated activities ie, heart attacks car crashes brought on by the shelling. The U.S. Gov't still attributed the sighting a weather balloon like it did with Roswell. The original negative of the historic news photo from the L.A. Times is missing. Could there a cover up of that event like Roswell? Someone needs to post the entire movie . This is a good movie ! Best pearl harbor themed comedy ever! I can't wait for the sequel about the holocaust!
Agatha Was 	looking forward to this. But it's just dull. I too would like to see or find a copy of the movie. What a gem. How on earth could it have been buried all of these years. Is the complete movie to be found somewhere? One of the least-known best movies yet to be rediscovered.
The Concorde... Airport '79 	Did you know the Concorde used in this movie was the one that crashed in Air France flight 4590? worst movie ever flawless "I've got the best seat in the house!" The darkest Moments of George Kennedy and Alain Delon... Did anybody of them ever had get the scriped BEFORE they signed the contract? Awesome "Special Defects" Is  this really the official trailer? It should be called: "the compilation of all the scenes that should convince you NEVER to watch this movie". That's JJ This movie is a big LOL, as Sharknado. Does this film have two different titles?When I saw it, 30-odd years ago, it was called Airport 80. Utter shit this one. Sorry but I can't enjoy this one, no matter how much I try! Amazing that screenwriter Eric Roth wrote this back in the day! Well, hell.. that was the whole movie in less than 3 minutes. R.I.P Obama's in this? That was a good film thanks for the upload. I've just seen a three hour version of It. I need a drink. Oh, Gawd! John Davidson is EVERYWHERE! Horrible that this is the very same plane that would end up in the real Concorde crash. Makes you wonder Why is George Kennedy in every Airport movie? Interesting
Alien 	The path to paradise begins in hell. how does this equal a sequel to Prometheus and to alien movie s? I'm confused as I know a female plus robot ended Prometheus going somewhere, but it doesn't show that. I can't believe they still make such a shitty movies..send me back to 90s hello Cool huh!...Prometheus Alien: Cove t movie NOW available in HD quality Stream now https://plus.google.com/115414785859243067536/posts/AzvCNw7eLjj Predetor is the best You know, I honestly don't have any interest in seeing this movie. It's not that the movie looks bad, it's just that it feels too different from the Alien movies that I fell in love with. The old ones just had a fantastic down-to-earth quality (ironic since they were in space) that I don't think you can capture anymore. My parents childhood nightmares are coming back. A piece at a time. omg the aliens are so sexy now Anyone watched AvP (Alien vs Preterdor?) is this the same planet as in prometheus? I would say about this is i think the first one is better than this one for now do u guys agree.? very very bad movie not make sense story The aliens are pretty much like the ailens in alien isolation The background music is just like music in Interstellar trailer 101: Don't show the monster! worst movie I have ever seen this movie is so bad Vegan Aliens? Game over, man!
All That Jazz 	Leland Palmer?? It's Show Time! The single greatest film ever made. Fosse is the only director to win the Emmy, the Tony, and the Oscar all in the same year. It will never be done again. 0:34 - I like this part If you hate the movie Chicago, will you also hate this movie? That cool lighting rig that spells out "ALL THAT JAZZ" is utilized to better effect in this trailer than it was in the actual movie! Roy Scheider is one of the great underrated and misappreciated actors that emerged out of the New Hollywood era.  I thought he was great in "The French Connection", "Jaws", "Marathon Man" and "Sorcerer" and everyone says this is his best performance - I have to see it!!! "Apocalypse Now", "Manhattan", "Tess" and "Kramer vs. Kramer" came out that year.  I haven't seen this or any of Fosse's films - but for me personally "Apocalypse Now" is going to be near impossible to beat as the best film of 1979.  I really want to see this though, "Star 80" and Fosse's other films as well. How he lost out on the Oscar will forever baffle me.  One of the greatest film performances ever. Great performance Roy Scheider. Bob Fosse was a dynamic choreographer, dancer, and director, BUT, if he was like Joe Gideon was in this movie, he was one dysfunctional dude. Why is it that the most talented, are also the most screwed up? At any rate, THIS was the best movie of 1979; Nothing else that year could compare. I think so anyway. @Magnolia296 what about the warriors  I adore this film - marvelous, gorgeous, melodious......with great acting, producing, editing, directing. Roy Scheider deserved the Oscar for this role - phenomenal acting. Other actors/actresses were brilliant too1979 is one of my all time favorite years in film - All That Jazz, Alien, Rocky 2, Apocalypse Now, Moonraker, Mad Max, Kramer vs Kramer, The China Syndrome, The Brood, Tess, 1941 etc @Benkoolest No wonder, you don't even know how to spell! God... @bojler9357 oh goody another person who needs everything to be HQ or HD....just watch it.... i thot this movie was terrible... i dont kno wat anybody sees in this :(  Coming soon..........me too, after seeing that. Totally tubular to the max!xoxoThe Clarences LOL whats HQ on this R.I.P. Roy Scheider....
An American Christmas Carol 	I like what they did with this adaption. in the original it always felt to me that scrooge resented Cratchit, becasue Cratchit was like his moral conscious and acted as a constant reminder of his humnaity. Here they do the same with Slade and thatcher, thatcher makes Slade face his conscious and he doesn't like it so he fires him. 79 - a good year for American tales of tradition and hope. All Negative Comments Ignored!!-Thank You Again Eslinger Ultramedia For Sharing. We Do Appreciate It.-N.C. This is the movie that put Henry Winkler tops as an actor in my books! Thank You For Sharing This Great Movie-I really Hope It Stays Up All Year-This Is a 24/7-365 Day A Year Movie-After All Christmas Is a Year Long Event!! winkler stinks. scrooge with a Noo Yawk accent. terrible happy days hey it's the Fonz I have not seen this version I just subbed I really like this version ,especially since I know this town. It is filmed in Elora ,Ontario, Canada .The town is still very much the same :) Thanks for posting this wonderful movie. Thank God for what you have Merry Christmas Thanks for movie...sure there are other people out there going though what I am losing my house next month etc. etc. Maybe end up homeless. Don't lose faith sometimes bad happen to good people. Put a smile on your face. Store your treasures in heaven. Excellent. Benedict Slade ran the Rentacenter of his day. Not impressed. This is the best modern adaptation, I have seen, but I still prefer the older British version starring Alistair McClean.  But I would not get a copy of that either.  Because it seems weird seeing the same thing every Christmas - the old man standing on his head, exposing himself, and then attempting to bribe the housemaid from reporting him to a bobby... But for some strange reason, it does not seem weird to me, to watch, It's a Wonderful Life, every year, a movie about a suicidal man being asked to reconsider sticking around - though it seem flawed, with the noticeable absence of a "black" man, but given the geographical terrain, and migration patterns, I suppose it is like saying, Where are the Germans?, when you walk around in one of the other cities of France, besides Paris.  Scrooge - he is made a better man, for giving away cash?  That seems communistic, robin hoodish, or something.  Love is a feeling, which may, or may not, express itself as an action.  Yet, in this movie, his charity giving is thoughtful.  He needs X, she desires Y, both of which requires Z.  The love OF money : what can I get with this nickel?  The love FOR money : I need A to acquire B.  What do you desire, and why?  Focus.  Price tag, legal parameters, should be a secondary consideration. .. Die Hard - "tired"? - a Christmas movie?  He spends much of the movie, in a state of "no shirt, no shoes" and "no service" poverty, yet, is he not rich?  He has, no wait, they're divorced... Nothing about this is an improvement on the original classic, yet obviously the makers thought they could do better than Dickens.
The American Success Company 	I remember this being called the american success company Wow Jeff Bridges looks so young! WoW!!!! What a Beautiful Film!!!
Americathon 	In 1998, America has gone to hell...but the TV's still work. A personal favorite. A much watch for that certain type of person. Elvis Costello! Is that the Beach Boys singing at the end? I don't want to sound like a dick or nothin' - But you talk like a fag, and your shit's all retarded. How sad it came true! That jump by Meatloaf in the car scene looked pretty cool. I like how they spell Eddie Money's first name wrong (Eddy) at the end. Idiocracy was a ripoff of this. "Meat Loaf vs the last living automobile!" I Wish Harvey Korman was My Father or How "Americathon" is Nowhere Near as Unfunny as Buck Henry's "First Family"...Late '70's California always seemed so perfect n' inviting, it was all going to be okay, if you found your way to this magical place in the sun. Everything felt like the opening credits to "Three's Company", at least it seemed that way on television. At times, this rarely seen treat from the melded mind-force of Proctor and Bergman, rivals the upper-echelon comedic writing being done by the staff at SCTV. Was there a more ingratiating screen presence during this period as Korman, who alongside a pre-vice arrest "Jerry Hubbard", always induced non-stop smiles in feel-good comfort food such as this. Revisit those feelings once again, everything is going to be just fine... I just watched this. I seen it way back when, but forgot about it. I have to say after watching it, it kind if gave me hope in some strange kind of way.  Wow! Fred Willard was young once! Jack Tripper CLIFFORD is president?! I wanna see it just for that! The prequel to Idiocracy? It is. Join us.
The Amityville 	Horror One of the very few Horror Movie Remakes that was just as good, if not better than the original. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George were both phenomenal actors in this. And Melissa George alone is SOO underrated as an actress...and did I mention that she's sexy as hell? Ohhh man, that body.... I've had a secret crush on Melissa George, ever since I saw this film. She is absolutely, hands down drop-dead Gorgeous. whats the song that goes from 0:38 to 0:46 I actually didn't mind this one.. better than the latest, with the brother in a coma.. that was dumb. Utter fucking wank ; overdone to death.Give me the original every time. Had the 1979/2005 double-pack bought as an Xmas pressie.Why do I get the feeling that I am not going to be impressed with this remake?Hollywood's remakes are always overdone to death. i thought it was in Pennyslvania...... Great one WHERE THE EXPLOSIONS who came here from the conjuring Is that the American Horror Story house? from Conjuring 2 Yes it was I been to the real house in new york was it a tru story??? Because Hollywood film makers are just too lazy to write stories these days, that's why. shit movie
Anatomy of a Seduction 	The love scene in which Susan Flannery's character "Maggie" succumb's to Jameson Parker is one of the best screen kisses ever! Please upload this movie The first  "Cougar" movie..at least for made-for-tv..i think
And Baby Makes Six 	I even never seen a baby is talking good film song is:my house I love this movie so good and hilarious I just saw this last night, it wasn't really a top notch movie, the movie itself was nicely animated but I think they kinda tried to hard for this, I didn't laugh at any of the jokes but I did love the ending, and the three twin babys. Good:) ....my last video is about Baby Boss and Pokemon car, it's new 2017 But seriously though who sat down at the Dreamworks meetings and said you know what would be just hilarious "a baby in a suit with Alec Baldwin's voiceover trying to destroy puppies - would really be another minions" ....... A lec bald win I dont wear a hat What is the name of the song at the very start of the trailer???? I am DESPERATE to know, if anyone can tell me!!!! The boss Baby change the world This movie sucks. Just give up DreamWorks... boss baby cancer calling boss baby (HE ACTUALLY ANSWERED OMG :OOO) music name plese do you know what's the real problem with this movie?the "CALLING THE BOSS BABY!*OMG HE ANSWERED!!!*" videos. what' s that song err this looks Ok, but I probably won't feel the need to see it more than once. funny and positive movie~like it~ hahah
And I Alone Survived 	Americs=terroterrorists There is  no war in past 60 years without u.s.a.If there is a rich place without any kind of war,they will make it hapen,so easy.They will kill your neighbor and make it like you kill them and many,many other bad things they make it hapen.I don,t hate American people,but their political is soo bad,thay are world biggest a thief...After ww2 the most profit is Usa,they got nazi scientists,tehnology,and many,many more.Just make a spot on whole world and they make war for some interes....Solders in movie,what they defend?Usa?Aha,yes,same way like they defend Albanians on Kosovo and bombed my country in 1999.Usa made a state of 'Kosovo'world drugs center and only that drug money is their interes,like opium fields is Afgan,fuel and any,any more.9.11 is a top of their evil,kill your own people for reason to rob some country and make it logic to world.Sorry Usa folks but many of you know what your goverment is capable to do....Why american solders go to whole world,why?Somebody attack states?No,only reson is money and state interes and that is somebody wealth...For me hero is every man who died for own country,defend it,but if i die in some country 3000mile from my home,and i go there to make money,then i,m not a hero,then i,m just a men who kill for money......Off course any army make a reason that is not just like that,always is there some good patriotic reason..That guy in movie,is he a real hero?And if it happen just like in the movie?For me?No,no even if i,m american.But i,m a little sceptic for that combat,even Marcus story is diferent from that muslim who help them,and some more other things...Sorry for my bad english and greeting for all good people. This movie is  as unreal as it gets...Wahlberg must have been 260 lbs at the end cuz of all the led in every single part of his body hahaha. A little bit too much Hollywood right there ;) this is a movie about war, boo war! Bullshit sells # no violence I heard that Mark Wahlberg made fools of the Special Forces by getting men who flashed their butts to mock. "What do you think the phones for? You think they're going to call Domino's Pizza?" LOL mark Wahlberg should be the sole survivor from fallout. I respect all the soldiers, irrespective of their countries. They all go through these intensive training, which can't be described in words, to become perfect soldiers. I feel sad when a soldier is killed. I mean, all that talent and skills just gone in the blink of an eye. Want so bad to join the army when im older but I'll never be able to physically fight for them :( Best war movie ever!... Calm down It's just a movie ALL ABOARD THE AMERICAN HATE TRAIN. Where we circle jerk about how horrible the big bad Americans are and how they're 'the real terrorists',  all the while ignoring the horrors that is radical Islam and oppressive foreign regimes. You are all so backwards. These fucks should be banded up, dropped over Taliban controlled areas and told 'you'll be alright, you hate Americans as much as they do!', and see just how long it takes for your head to end up on a spike. disgusting hippie fucks. I've been reading the comments and oh my GOD THE IGNORANCE! if you have not been in combat, if you have not experienced first hand encounters of what it is like to be at war, SHUT UP! Ok friends, let us face the facts: 1. The USA is losing in Iraq 2. The USA is losing in Afghanistan 3. Michelle Obama is a tranny In Afghanistan we are fighting against the people who we funded and supported.Hillary Clinton In reality there were no more than around 20 taliban fighters, not 200. Lutrell himself in first report mentioned there were 30 talibans. Last night,  we had an exactly same situation. I am the only one survivor and writhing the comment here. I am talking about Ghost Recon Wildlands. Americans come to your country and kill random people = HeroForeigners come to America and kill random people = Terrorists 
...And Your Name Is Jonah 	@Everyone complaining about the sound in this video: The person who recorded this was most likely DEAF. How would he know that a) the movie's sound wasn't on? (Okay, he might have known, but it's possible that he forgot. He probably didn't even think about it!) And b) that he was making noise in the background? If you're watching a movie clip centered around a deafness, you might want to consider that the person who recorded it was also Deaf and therefore /can't hear/. casually recording this while eating something and breathing heavily. I wonder what his mom thought he was doing in his room. Met Billy Seago in North Seattle Community College few years ago. He is such great talent actor. Where's the volume of the movie?? All we hear is this guy's very heavy breathing??  I didn't want to be the one to say it but it's sounded like this person was jerking off over this clip. Was very off putting it has to be said.  I would love to see this as a DVD to watch as I loved this movie and I think this is why I am so passionate with people that have additional needs.I have tried every were to try and get a copy if anyone knows please let  me know I loved this scene, I had to rewind it and watch it a few times, I couldn't stop myself from tearing up!!! But... dude... there's no emotional music, or any sound for that matter... just your heavy breathing! lol srevetheblogger, i loved this movie on netflix but when i saw your trailer on youtube it was creepy. whats with the heavy brething and chewing sounds? gross. Well, I'm confused. I tried to look up the name of this movie as -And My Name is Noah. No wonder! Then I looked under IMDB Sally Struthers and it said the name of the movie is - And YOUR Name is Jonah.  In 1979 when I was flying with my deaf child and embarrassed to sign, some woman came up to me and told me about this movie. Made signing seem wonderful. Took me another 30 years before I saw the movie! Good movie though. whaaa! he's from the Bravo Family!wow..so young. This scene reminds me so much of The Miracle Worker when Helen Keller finally understood language. I LOVE it!!! P.S....why were you breathing so hard in this video???? So is this movie supposed to be silent... or did you just not record the sound for some reason? Hahahaha! I kissfist your comment about the caveman that can sign! LOL!
Animalympics 	what a great movie "Hello, I'm Kent Brockman and welcome to Animalympics." Hi oh my god where can i find the whole movie... i used to watch this as a child all the time!!!
Apocalypse Now 	I forgot San Holo fought during Vietnam the best of this music is the soundtrack, god its good Another great film depicting the Horrors of the Vietnam War. This is a terrible trailer. He just cut and pasted pieces of the movie in chronological order. Please don't attack me guys, but I didn't get this movie or what it was showing, I love other movies such as deer Hunter, full metal jacket, jar head, thin red line, come and see and just about every other anti war movie, but I just didn't get this one. Without hate, could someone explain it to me where can i find the full movie? I need to see this My dad and uncle watched this at 10 and 13!?! I am dead freakin serious SELL THE HOUSESELL THE CARSELL THE KIDS FIND SOMEONE ELSE FORGET IT I'M NEVER COMING BACKFORGET IT what is the name of the song in min 1:40 Can someone help me? I bought the redux version not knowing what it meant boy now I've seen it I want to see the original but what parts are cut out?? 1:40 did they play this is jarhead?? Pindos fascists Perfect movie, seriously this trailer is horrible lmao a great fuckin boring movie! i doesn't look like an old movie... It's based on "Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad...
Ashanti 	wow could remember this movie as far back Now THAT's a trailer.
The Attic 	This was the WORST WORST movie I've seen in my entire life ! I wanted to kill myself in my attic.  The main girl ....I believe she wanted so desperately to be a star that she accepted this crap. Please don't watch this shit. 1:23 DaDDario strikes again , Wrong movie. I was looking for the good one, from 1980 with Carrie Snodgress and Ray Milland. This film was based on the song Lost Reflections, by Crimson Glory (1983)?? That was lame I don't understand the end :o Looks low budget like your mom lol it was a good movie creepy Wow bad acting alert! Alexandra Daddario!! <3 I laughed until I cried! THE MOVIE IS PIECE OF SHIT DELETE IT. worst fucking movie ever, somebody kill me please The story wasn't so bad, but the acting was bad and camera work was also kinda bad Horrible,ofcourse,but all that horrible acting started to be funny eventually.Besides the crappy acting the camera is very crappy ,and the camerman especially,so if you ever thought about watching it...Don't.Or smoke some weed before you watch it,maybe then it will be interesting,but naah. whota shity camera Saw it the other day, and it was horrible from the very beginning. It had no pasing, no build up, the acting was terrible, although I didn't see the twist coming. I wonder how the book is like... jjjjj It looks cool I am probably going to watch it It's actually a really good movie! The preview just makes it look terrible
Avalanche Express 	It's also based on a great book by Colin Forbes, who wrote some damn good spy thrillers during the 80s until he went right downhill. Lee Marvin ventures into James Bond territory...and nails it! just found a vhs copy in charity shop never seen a copy anywere  should be a laugh to watch,   Tim Interesting use of stills in this trailer. I wonder if this had anything to do with the problems that hit the production. I've seen parts of this on TV in the 80's, so I'm looking forward to the Archive disc, though my expectations are being kept reasonable. I've long wondered what kind of movie it would've been had Robson and Shaw not died, although after EARTHQUAKE, one couldn't expect much from the former, and the latter had been cranking out these "spectaculars" for far too long.
Bear Island 	I love this video. Guys, this is awersome <3 thank you for sharing this PD: aren't you cold? :O you guys are freaking awesome!

Being There 	Mark Cuban brought me here. I came here because one of Bill Maher's guest on Real time mentioned this Chauncey Gardner character. It was the show with Tomi Lahren being a guest. I agree with Bill Maher's guest and the black woman in the film. Smh about D.Trump! "Trump is Chauncey Gardener evil twin", Sam Harris on Real Time With Bill Maher, february 3 2017. "Re: Should be Reissued: Trump personifies Chance It's not an exact parallel, but I do see one important similarity. It seems to me that Donald Trump gained as much popularity and success as he did because almost anything he said or did was immediately re-interpreted by his listeners. Early in his campaign, his supporters stopped cheering for what he promised to do, and began cheering for what they felt it meant. White supremacists saw him as an opportunity to have one of their own in power. Working class people saw him as someone who championed their neglected concerns. Americans who felt the government was out of touch with them, saw Trump as an outsider who would clean up political corruption. And so forth, every faction seeing and hearing what they wanted to. I've heard interviews with some of his supporters who raved about his promise to expel certain racial groups from the U.S., and how that would logically lead to cracking down on minorities; and with other supporters, who laughed and said that of course he would never do such an awful thing, and didn't intend to. They listened to the same speech, but heard completely different messages. It seemed to be the same all around. Just like Chance, Donald Trump was a blank canvas on which everyone applied what they expected, or what they wanted. He would say outrageous things sometimes, or ridiculous things, or even patently untrue things, and voters would hear something seemingly unrelated to his actual words. It worked, but what happens next? He's been elected now, and even his supporters still don't agree on what he can be expected to do. What would happen if Chance were elected president?"- imdb.com Probbily one of the best "high minded" movies ever made. You have to be very sharp to "get it" elsewise, it makes no real sense to you. One of my favourite movies I've ever seen That was the opening of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony at the start? Made me forget he was (is) Clouseau for a few hours. Former President Bill Clinton's  ny comes to mind. I am convinced Steve Carrel is  our generation's Peter Sellers and like Sellers, the Emmys robbed him. Peter is just god Sounds like Donald Trump! The music "Also Sprach Zarathustra" in this trailer was also heard in the original trailer for "The Peanuts Movie". You don't have to worry Tom, masturbation won't give it to you One of the best movies out of a great period. And Sellars is priceless. Inimitable, classic. I never saw this movie, but damn, that's one helluva cast! Everyone has different tastes. Some like it some dont. White version of Ben Carson I think this movie gets somewhat slammed by people who think Sellers couldn't play a straight character. I think it's a great performance and the subtle humor is excellent. Peter Sellers had wanted to make this movie for over 10 years.
The Bell 	Jar kathy, it's interfere*. and your trailer is not official, it's a click bait wow! what is the name of the music piece used to it?
Best Boy 	Id watch it this should be a movie but you pretty much showed all the good parts MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE PLEASE what a lame this is  not  the  beastboy I seen beast boy needs his own movie like if u agree Fake u used other movies u used planet of  the apps this is fake i know this movie Es falls este trailer bbs green brah In the trailer he's not green when he turns in two animals i wish they made a movie about beast boy cuz that would be AWESOME That's nasty whenever he opened his mouth and it's a human person that's disgusting Fake tf 1:26 what movie or show is that beast boy Fake??? this gonna be awesome... majestic Why can this not be realplease someone make this real
Beyond the Poseidon Adventure 	"A violent Mediterranean storm" but wasn't it an underwater earthquake? sir michael caine will do anything for a buck remember jaws 4 ha ha haaaaaaaaaa U feel like the only good ones are the original poseidon adventure from 1972 and the from 2006 with Kurt Russel. in 1:52 did the ship explode? Even the trailer is bad. The ship wasn't sunk by a storm. She was sunk by a giant wave caused by an undersea earthquake. 1.20 It's Agent Gibbs from NCIS!! Holy shit....Slim Pickins is in this thing..? He ain't no Red Buttons but it's still gotta be worth a watch. The Original movie was a classic. This..Not so much. I'm presently watching it on TMC. Unless Shelly Winters floats up as a hungry Zombie...This Tanks! one of the many underrated movies of all time How to spoil a movie in 2 minutes. somewhere in the ship is an evil Hollywood producer that won't stop making shitty sequels BEst example, how to ruin a movie! I love this movie!
Bizalom 	Could've been such a great movie without the shitty ending... A movie about what happens when you try to pull off a heist with a millenial. Worst ending in movie history! um final sem sentido nenhum... afff The ending had me fucked up I want to see nic cage vs Godzilla ELIJAH WOOD YOUR AMAZING Best movie I've seen for a while. Cage was on-form throughout, and Wood was very believable. Looks like Eminem Frodo the investigator... Good job Mr Baggins. This was a good entertaining movie until that dumbass gave the girl a phone... its not a very good movie, but its a very good time I'll give you hundred dollar ?   OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a braindead End and Film! Doing all for the robbery and at End he has scruples! Better End: Take all the Money and give Girl 1 Million and not a damn Handycall! BRAINDEAD! Song 1:00 please :D :D :D This was an alright heist movie. what the hell kind of ending was that shit?
The Black Hole 	lol he so selfish he deserved it loci this is what happens if your greedy lol Now don't ever touch a paper will a black circle in it.. XD at the end where he climbs in the vault... bye have a great time:-) A fucking good fiction it can make a millions of dollars through a various pretend as shiiit more like a magic big black dot... LOL this is a short film, not a trailer It's more like a portal than black hole. -_- facepalm. why would you go inside? the safe wasnt even that big. and the hole was surely not big enough to fit a person, it was office paper. small paper. why is everybody so hypersensitive about the god damn title? that's inposibble in would break the universe, time and matter black holes are not science its created from space and if it was on that paper the world would be destroyed in like 3 days. But if you put your hand through that black hole and then take it back out your hand would be gone or rather there its 50% 50% chance so you would die if you went through that with your whole body cause there's so much pressure so you would die. Mairieolla Black holes would not just simply sit there it would start sucking up all the matter it could growing bigger and final sucking up the solar system, if the man got that close to it it would accelerate the part of his body closest to the black hole or in the event horizon faster than the rest of his body so he would be ripped cell from cell into the black hole and if for some very very strange reason it like out gassed or something and dies it would have still caused mass extinction just because of how much radiation was edited. So in conclusion, least researched movie of whatever year this was made. I didn't bother looking because it's not worth my time. Interstellar is still better... This trailer is absurd. When he is sticking his hand inside of the black hole, wouldn't his hand get shriveled to smithereens at the event horizon and get crushed into nothing at the quantum singularity? Also he can't get his hand out of the event horizon because light cannot escape from it. He would just get devoured into the gaping mouth of the black hole. I would've only taken about 10,000
Black Jack House of Cards 	. maths nerds are the best Okay that trailer is shit af but i genuinly love that movie it's so good what I like about this movie is that it highlights the unfairness of being poor. This guy tried as hard as he could, and even got accepted early at Harvard med. Unfortunately, money got in the way. In the trailer it showed he got 100% on his test, in the movie, he got 97%. This movie is so fucking shit it's funny wasted time on holywood movie.  zero for movie what is the name of this movie? great movie, stupid Netflix took it off. :( Free Live Sex Cam Show, Exclusive Unlimited Access:      BabeGirlsHere.BlogSpot------------------c0m whats the song in 0:52?

The Black Stallion 	I'm crying already My favorite movie ever. RIP Melissa Matheson.. I first saw this on video at age 4 or 5. Watched it countless times since and it still holds up beautifully. Cinematic poetry is what it is. R.I.P. Mickey Rooney, you were so precious in this. <3 This movie and that narrator's voice takes me back to being a young child long ago.Haven't seen this movie in 30 years when VHS video was king of home movie enjoyment.
Bloodbrothers 	im ready yo watch  it soo bad BECAUSE it has Fetty wap  and trey songz that the only reason Fetty Wap acting now? Good thing bro found another hustle, because he ain't that hot musically right now. all yall hitting me up about fetty wap.. I wanna tell yall sum.. I DON'T CARE FOR FETTY!! if trey wasn't the main character or if he wasn't acting in this movie I probably would have never heard about it.. well at least not this early.. soo stop messaging me about sum damn fetty wap!! ion careee!!!! That's dope can't wait cuz wap's in the movie When it come out ?? fetty wap the best Looks low budget and full of NIGGERS I'll pass.

Fetty Wap Finally Just need to wait on a Month and Date I have been waiting all year to see this Movie! *they what's the name of the song thru playing Squaaaa Only wanna see this movie because of Fetty Wap
Bloodline 	looks boring as fuck I'm going to watch this for the background setting. I know I'm nitpicking but John and Meg don't look anything like their parents. Both have dark hair and Meg at least has dark eyes. Their parents are both blonde and blue eyed. Danny and Kevin fit the mould but I just think they should get that right. Also, they should show more of John's kids. I'm a fan of the show. I think it's pretty addictive and has you rooting for the minor characters moreso Waiting patiently for Season Three. Love this damn series. Need more of (dead) Danny though! I just might get into this.... This show kicks ass plus I love how they film in the Fla. Keys, coolest place on earth. anyone know who's singing that metallica cover? does anyone know who is singing that song? I Love this show! it has been the best series Ive watched..but I could do less of the "f" word so much. It's no necessary to use it in every sentence. doesn't look very interesting, but Linda Cardellini always makes things interesting, with her hot, old, sexy ass :) This show isnt for people who wants action scenes, the story is slow but really one of the best shows right now, especially the acting is very good. I JUST  DONE WATCHING THIS  SOMEONE  TOLD ME ABOUT IT  ....I   FUCKIN LOOOVEDDDD IT ...EVERY  FUCKN CAST  WAS BRILLIANT...GOT  SOOO DARK & DARKER & FULL OF  TWIST  ...I COULDN'T  STOP   WATCHING  IT ...CANT WAIT  TO SEE  WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED  TO THE FAMILY  .. AFTER  SHIT  HIT THE FAN LIKE THAT  ....SOME OF THESE SERIES  I  DISCOVER  IS   FUCKIN BETTER  AN  HBO...I REALL LOVED THIS SERIES    DONT  FUCKIN MISS THIS ...WELL   DONE! amazing show most underrated show ever What the hell did they do to that song...ruined song is ruined. Last chance. I'm on episode 3. The first 2 episodes/hours had about an hour of un-needed wasted time. Episodes 1 and 2 could have been combined. So far NOT on the edge of my seat.....
Boardwalk 	You ccan't find this movie with better qualityy than here => https://twitter.com/b9673508732f7f9d2/status/858504266066964480 I'm just finish the wire ... and I'm just here cuz of Omar little ...  mr pink! best serie ever. i love how people comment on peaky blinders videos suggesting boardwalk empire and vice versa haha I'll have to rewatch it this Christmas Great stuff... I like Steve Buscemi on Portlandia, too. What trump has actual done or will be doing is he has turned the pretend world of World WRESTLING into reality for some percentage of this country and all we can honestly hope is its a tiny sector Trump has filled every position of power with lobbyist! His family business will be contractors to everything he hired them to for the move in the white house! We will be lucky if his is nucky figure because atleast he will have some kind of heart! There is no hope this is the world the Republicans will now try to recreate!!! His not even being coy about it we are fucked!!! But threw pain comes strength we always do this shit! Before we become reborn!!! So sadly the more hurt with a trump figure the faster we will become one nation with no factions in power working to be that shinning hill we never can be! Track name? miss this fucking show I don't like boring series, fuck No! but guys try watch (the wire)  Season 1 is fucking boring then real shit happend.. this is one of the greatest tv shows ever cr3ated, martin scorsecse is one of the greatest directors 7 episodes in the first season and I'm not that into it... does it get any better? When first seeing this trailer I was like: shit I have to watch this, I was really pumped. Now seeing the trailer again, I feel like watching the show for the second time. But I'm going to wait till some years, so hopefully I can forget some things about the plot in the meantime. If you haven't seen this show and you slightly like this trailer, go and wacht the damn show, you will be amazed. If you like this show, then I'd suggest Peaky Blinders. yess
Boulevard Nights 	Real Mexicans are Eases . Not like nothers . Nothers want to be black jijiji Those fucker are not chicanos those are fake. Hell no ese . Not me . I'm Mexican and I'm very proud of it . name of song 1:59 with the hat wasent he in the American me movie and he was in the mexican mafia Fucking bad ass movie! big VGV Does any one know the beginning song i used to dress like an oldschool cholo and id wish i coud lived in those days. and lisent to oldies all the time. i hated everyting that had to do with blaks but now i like there style instead long silver chains and music norputas dont even have the right to be watching this kind of movies or even talk like the chicanos from the movie gangsters now dress  like they just shitted themselves... VIVA Xicanozzz that's true we all copy each other except chink's they lames talkin bout Asians nippers I have to admit they dressed better and were real unlike some of these fake wannabes these days listening to drake. Mexicans killing Mexicans. Killing your own people. So sad. I born in the wrong place at the wrong time The cholo anti-authoritarian nature can be traced to the bandido outlaws of the 1800s.I don't know why black people have a hard time admitting that they imitate Chicano gang culture, but these idiots debating what gang came first is sad. there is no crip of blood gang that goes back past 1969. Go to South LA (formerly South Central, the heart of the Bloods and Crips) and find out for yourself what is the oldest gang there. go to West LA and find out when the oldest gang there formed and by whom. Keep in mind that black gangs of California DO NOT resemble ANY black gangs in the Midwest or East Coast. The Pachucos were trying to imitate the look of the Mafia, not some jive ass jazz musician (I can't think of a single Mexican that listens to jazz). keep in mind that this is a period where there was no social media, no Internet, few had access to radio and even less had a tv, most didn't even know what the president looked like let alone know what jazz musicians looked like. Crip slang is derived from cholo slang. Black gangs on both coasts deny heavily that they imitate Mexican and Italian gang culture. Red and Blue rags were waved by hardened prison inmates years prior to Stan Tookie Williams' middle school introduction of "cripping".  Eazy E may have rapped about cruising in a 64, but Google who was the first to hit the switch. The only thing Chicanos have followed almost religiously is black musicians (oldies, funk, freestyle, gangster rap). The gangster rap scene was propelled by Latinos playing the music on rotation on KDAY (search who the Mixmasters were). Urban/prison tattooing (stuff from the last 70 years) is derived from Chicano art. The Dogtown skating brand is derived from the neighborhood gang with the same name. The gang Graffiti goes beyond the 40s (earlier than Phillie and NY) as documented by Chaz Bojorquez. no, Crips and Bloods were not influenced by the Black Panthers, when have you heard about Black Panthers hunting down and killing blacks for the fuck of it? Never. When have black Panthers dressed in the attire of gang member? When have You read about Black Panthers lowriding on Whittier Blvd? Don't tarnish their name by associating them to gang members, the simple fact is black gang culture on the West Coast is an imitation of Chicano gang culture. get over it. unity fools we better then the rest we got cultura stay firme and dont let them try bring us down God bless the truth the real and most important our lives can take our lands and haaa in the future less racist pigz hallmoniters and more of mi Culture haaaaa Anyone got a link to were I can watch this movie ??? All Raza Unidos... North ,South, Mexico.... We are all hermanos.... No other race cares if we kill eachother or hate eachother.... imagine us all together.... no race would ever want to see that power.... Chicano Power. Love Conquers hate.
Breaking Away 	This was the greatest Midwestern theme movie of all time - even better than "Hoosiers" this was the greatest midwestern romantic movie of all time....not saying that much. but it was a great movie I'm 54 and still somewhere between growing up and settling down. WTF! buena Great movie, but just a horrible trailer. remade as jo jeeta wahi sikander Love this movie! Finally got a chance to watch again now that I quit my day job. <3 Good stuff! I love this movie...Paul Dooley is hilarious as the dad. Brilliant! Such a fun and delightful film, Love his fake italian. Adore this Movie ITs funny to compare the comedic timing in the editing of this trailer to trailers of today. there is so much silence and empty beats...haha so awkward. Almost makes it seem ironically funny. HAHAHA! Sorry should be best university One of my favorite films.  Set in the best city and universities in the world. I played the car wash owner , with jackie , it was fun that day... A bit of trivia: Paul Dooley and Dennis Christopher played father & son two other times: in "A Wedding" (around the same time as this) and much later in a pretty good episode of "Law & Order: Criminal Intent" ("Cherry Red"). You can almost imagine them in Criminal Intent as the same characters 25 years later.
The Brood 	what music is this trailer from? This is creepy Gotta see this later on today.
Buffet Froid 	very epic movie
The Bugs Bunny/Road-Runner Movie 	This brought back memories. I used to have this VHS as a kid.  The line they said about kids watching it over and over?  Yeah, they didn't lie. Take from The Fearless Four 1998 VHS
Butch and Sundance 	Myy gf reallyy loves this film. Weee found full mooovieeee hereee => https://twitter.com/dbc1f01543fe63c5a/status/822785146273218560 I came here because of Top Gear yes, more of this, please! You guys are sitting on top of cinema history, share it with us! This movie changed all movies made after it as far as the hero/villain dynamic is concerned.
C.H.O.M.P.S. 	Valerie Bertinelli is the hottest girl to ever live. Great movie for the family. Why hasn't this been remade? I remember this Movie when I was just a kid and it was dubbed in Afrikaans. how is this a family movie?! the part when the dogs eyes glow is scary as shit!! that has to be probably the most scary thing ever!! and the part when the guy takes his head off is scary too!! obviously this should be a horror film!! no wonder why this is considered one of the worst movies ever!! valerie bertenelli probably regrets making this movie. ill never look at dogs the same way again!! william hannah and joseph barbera were 2 geniuses then they go out and make this awful film!! WHAT DRUGS WERE THEY ON?! plus why are there guns in this movie. what kind of family movie is this?! I remember this!  I was 5 years old when I saw it! Thumbs up if you're here after watching the 1985 David Letterman interview with Valerie Bertinelli. Didn't that mean black dog who talked (bad idea, BTW) say "shit" at the end of the film? Not very family friendly... they our working on robotdog called bigdog give it few year we realy have robot dog like this  Oh my gosh - I *totally* forgot about this bit of the movie where the guy told him a number and the dog did some command. This was my favorite movie in childhood, always been a huge dog lover. So awesome to see this again.  Valerie Bertinelli seems to be onboard rather quickly. Terminator was totally ripping this off. Yes! totally! Good 70's porn music at :58 "chomps, 33"  (he humps my leg) Is it just me or did I just hear the theme from scooby doo at the end
California Dreaming 	i love this song who agrees this was good but the original is still my personal favorite. fook californja  over Anyone is here because of Famous in love? WHAT THE CRAP! this song is better than the original song! I can picture this song in other movies such as world war z 2012 the day after tomorrow etc Famous In Love brought me here yes Sia was the best part of this movie, and I'm not even joking If this really happened...0_0 is it the tsunami is it the tsnami
Cannibal Holocaust 	Watched this for a film class. I really wish I could hate this movie for all of the horrible things depicted simply for shock value, but the narrative and sound design are just... so brilliant. Not to mention the feat of the crew carrying physical film around a hot and humid environment. The Worst Movie. Have a big drink before watching this. I liked it, but it's crazy. why did I watch it when I was 13 why why why I should never had wathced it, DON'T watch this omfg Amazing movie. The first Found-Footage film ever made. Shit movie...disgusting the song brings back some memories, man I'm sobbing the music for this trailer is amazing. Who is else is here from MTV's snapchat discovery thing lol Yummy puta que pariu filme do demonio green inferno was better. lol, this music whaat.. shit movie On the outside, this is a horror movie. On the inside, it is a critique of our society. Great movie, go watch it.
Captain America 	Content such calculate skirt successfully assert just around anticipate Still chills from watching this, this trailer and move will never get old ^^ Iron Man 4: Civil War I'm a huge Marvel Fan, but my god this movie was both a disappointment and a stupendous movie. (In my opinion.). See full Version Herehttps://plus.google.com/107054917497690884161/posts/hjhKJrkDAxH Just watched "Captain America: Civil War" on YouTube. Excellent! So what's next for Captain Rogers(America) and Co.? I know Iron Man(Tony Stark) will be featured in "Spider Man: Homecoming" coming in July. But what about Black Widow, Falcon, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Winter Solder, Black Panther and War Machine? When will we see them again? Please let me know. Too sad this movie sucked. i need this soundtrack best trailer ever watching after a year same goosebumps I'm a big D.C. fan (also Marvel) and I say a lot that people who complain about "bad" D.C. movies just complain about it because it's not Marvel. But I will admit that this trailer was really really good, and the movie was equally as good. In fact I loved it, and I also love the new D.C. movies that are coming out and that have been out (DCEU). Marvel has/will have a lot of great movies same with D.C. We all just need to relax and enjoy/respect the films for what they are, a form of entertainment for all of us to enjoy. Please take this with a grain of salt disappointing movie This movie blew, g: STILL GIVES ME CHILLS the trailer is actually more awesome than the movie I didn't think this film was all that great. I was actually pretty disappointed... 2:11 oh  2 vs 1, is that a fair fight? jshdy
Captain America II 	Captain America is great superhero charecter.. Best MCU movie of all time What if it was these versions of Bucky and Steve who fought Tony in CACW everyone start to loving cap after seeing this movie One of Marvel Studios' better films. I can't believe they spoiled The Winter Soldier being Bucky in the trailer! Just came back to watch it cos I read that they did this, I didn't want to believe it, but it's true! Why would they do this?! this movie was absolute garbage this trailer is so so bad but film is the  best of all Marvel films. Age of Ultron has the best trailer but film isn't so good as trailer. i don't know how MCU thinks but i hope that Infinity War is going to have trailer as good as film. sorry for my grammar. Thr best in mcu but cant top spiderman 2 and logan, or even dofp I like how they muted Bucky's name when Steve said: ''People are gonna die Bucky, I can't let that happen''. Was the winter soldier meant to be after age of ultron cause didn't shield fall during the winter soldierAnd if the avengers were active then doesn't that mean shield was still alive anyone know the name of the artist of the music in this trailer? what's next ,the summer soldier still the best mcu movie 2nd being gotg. 2017 and this trailer still gives me Goosebumps. his a ghost you'll never find him until you actually do and dc fan says that marvel are kiddish Music by: "I am waiting for you last summer"

We all (at least the majority of us) cried like a baby. Seriously, it was fucking sad. Haven't cried like today for a long time because of a movie. The acting of T.J. was so real and heartbreaking. The ending also broke my heart :( no rocky was 1975 mi pelicula favoritaaa Ricky Schroder stole the movie - thumbs up if you came here from 24 I CRIED SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!! En donde la puedo ver ? soy amante de las buenas peliculas de epoca ! can any please upload the full movie lol, i love when people are honest about stuff like that :) I'm a 19 year old guy, but this movie made my dad and I cry like a couple bitches...

The China Syndrome 	6yr old selling lemonade on my corner said after I asked how she made it, and what were the ingredient's, her response: SPRING WATER, FRESH ORGANIC LEMONS GROWN LOCALLY, RAW SUGAR, AND "MOM'S" PROPRIETORY INGREDIENT ! one of the BEST proper films I'll ever have known to see.never again in a billion will you see films as good as this....kiss my arse 1999 onwards 12 days after the movie was released, Three Mile Island happened. Impeccable timing! Today the media would tell you that it's good for the economy and must be tolerant of the China syndrome. Where can I see the full movie pls?
Christmas Lilies of the Field 	I did not know they had a sequel.
Circle of Iron 	I want to buy the DVD just for this scene 0:50 #lol ha Gayyy!
Cuba Yo 	where can I see this muvie man lindo protagonista.  lo conozco es bien funny and Good jjjjj
The Dark holy shite...	I've been looking for the title of this movie after watching it well over 10 years ago Wenn man den Film bei Google shopping eingibt kommt nur the dark night =^/ very confusing and shitty movie Sean bean died, kidding underrated movie. so dark. love it an old movie, but really good. i love that you hear her voice every now and then. This movie is so good.. Finally found it. Good The end of the movie is mean. Hat auch etwas von dem Game Silent Hill Der kommt grade auf Pro7:3 name for this movie ? where can i find this movie????? does boromir dies in this one too? Haha, true:) That comment was like a year ago lol.And once again, it was a Boromir MemeGoogle it :)Regardless of weather she walked off or not, one does not simply walk off a cliff  She doesn't walk of the cliff either. Watch the movie and you'll see.. I'm sure they have allot of melancholic thoughts going through their heads, and it probably would be a difficult decision to make, so I would say the same, One does not Simply walk off a cliff(Also it is a Bromir Meme, Google if you don't get it) :) well what do you say about suiciders then?
The Day It Came to Earth 	This is painfully, blissfully, awful. pos flick. highly inteliget critter from space and they walk slow and mumble a growls. $27 they should have got their money back The actor who played Lieute t Kelly was Bob Ginnaven, my Uncle. He was married to my Mother's younger Sister. He was a very down to earth man, very family devoted and had a rich voice that, once you heard it, you never forgot it. Is there any reason to watch this other than to see the gorgeous Rita Wilson at her prime. Saw this on Elvira's Movie Macabre. The hostest with the MOSTEST ;-)Plus, it has Rita Wilson, Tom Hank's wife. Can't lose!Thanks man! Lonesome George. What a treat!! Good ole George Gobel. Great old movie.  Thanks for the upload. This film is edited? They bleep out the cus words. Great movie for a Halloween party. Actually it came to earth at night. It's mentioned on Rita Wilson's IMDB page.  5 years into her career.  Must have been a dry spell there. This movie cost $117 to make and earned $27 at the box office.  Pretty impressive! "I think what we're dealing with here is a Geological Gaseous Goon." If they were going for the campy 1950's sci-fi look, they aced it!  If they were trying to make a serious movie, EPIC FAIL!  This movie is so bad, it's actually good! lol Blue pants getting out of the car to go into the police station, brown pants in the station. Yes, I do remember George Goble.  I even remember the theme song melody from his show.  I seem to remember he also hosted some quiz show too.
Pilot Pirx's Inquest 	1:22:01 scene was later mocked in "Spaceballs". ferari 1 or ford mustang 2 majstersztyk <3 Pirx is an asshole in the relationship to his crew. In real life he would never be a supervisor. przeczytalem pilota pirxa kilka dobrych lat temu ,wczesniej nie siegalem po ksiazke ,bo myslalem ,ze to dla dzieci ,tytul mnie zmylil i okazalo sie ,ze jednak to swietna ksiazka ,ale dzisiaj ,po tylu latach ,nie wiem ,juz mialem nieraz ,ze cos przeczytalem ,a po jakims dluzszym czasie ,okazalo sie ,ze sa o wiele lepsze i ciekawsze ksiazki The android kind of resembles the Brotherhood of Steel armour and could have inspired it since the game's original art designer came from Eastern Europe. The film itself is too cynical and stiff, but I like the android's punchline: "Your democracy what you call it, is nothing but a vehicle for the intrigue schemers to rule legitimately elected by a delinquent majority deliberately dumbed-down, manipulated and brainwashed specifically for the purpose of electing them" (expanded interpretation). Not that other systems such as Communism were any better, but then again advancing to the next phase of ruling by corruption and fraud making the delinquent majority expendible does not set a good example either, given how most democracies have been today succeeded by and subverted into ba a republics. It is hard to believe this was in seventees,  LEM IS GENIUS. AT 1:22:50 I did wet my pyjamas when I was 6 The plot and the music was so pcyhodelic. A great film by all means Heavily undrerrated sci -fi masterspiece. I saw the movie in Soviet Estonia early 80s as kid and was damn scared. Especially when I saw bare boobs!!! https://www.ioffer.com/i/test-pilot-pirx-1978-615065068 Szacun! Respect! Perfecto filma 1978 a jaj jaja jaj :))))
Diary of a Teenage Hitchhiker 	The girl took a risk..She got into a stranger's car and it is dangerous..She put herself in this situation..i hitchhiked once in my life but i was lucky even if i was a bit afraid.The guy was nice but i will never NEVER HITCHHIKE AGAIN.You can never come back and be murdered..i don't understand why so many girls used to take a ride in the seventies with perfect strangers.. Nostalgia... I had a high school sweetheart friend who loved to hitchhike. After graduating, she was picked up on her way across America to a Grateful Dead Concert. She never made it. She was found in a mid-west corn field, naked, murdered and sexually mutilated. Her killer was a suspected mass serial killer. He is on death row. Think and live safely. Wait for old age natural departure. Never put yourself in harms way, male or female. Men and boys get raped and murdered just like girls and women. It's sadly ironic that this very beautiful and talented young lady was murdered by a man she knew well. A man who should be rotting in prison to this day. I will always love you, Dominique. i remember this! this movie may be the reason I never accepted rides from people I didn't know. stranger danger.
Don Giovanni 	Don Giovanni in english??!!! Disgusting!! Love it! Porn opera! Why not performing in English and thus opening this great music and libretto to a wider audience?Why not in Mandarin or Arabic?who said that opera must be sung in Italian?We in Berlin have an old traditional opera house, where most operas, even the great Italian ones, are sung in German.You not like it, but it is successful. Check out for Komische Oper Berlin.Who said that art should not progress?Why are you folks so old fashioned, weak and afraid?Why are you afraid of the Sex in this Movie? Don Giovanni is about sex! Get over it.Didn't you know that Mozart himself was very fond of transforming old stuff into new forms?Didn't you know that he helped the Germans immensely by writing operas with German libretto instead of Italian?So, I myself enjoyed this movie a lot. I cannot hear it in English Kasper Holten has proven to be a complete dud; on film as well as in the theatre. Lets hope the ROH picks someone better for it's next director. che merda!!!!!!! schifo!!!!! suck!!!!!! mierda!!!!! Ughhhhh! Sad, very sad! This is porn, not opera.  And in English , it deforms the original. In English... that's absolutely horrendous. de gustibus Don Giovanni in inglese!!!!!!!!! Come cantare lady gaga in italiano...vera merda!!!! Placido Domingo spotted 1:17 Do I necessarily have to see a man's butt while trying to enjoy Mozart's gorgeous music? Call 911 at once!
The Double McGuffin 	When this movie came out my dad took a day off work and took my sister and me to see it. I had raging hormones for Lisa Whelchel. I wish they had the entire movie. I like it. great movie,,saw it as a kid! This movie is not a horror movie. But the trailer sounds like one. Saw as a kid. Luvd this movie as a kid..wish the whole movie was available. An all time great. Under appreciated classic. Could you post the whole movie?
Dracula 	the greatest movie u have ever seen.this movie deserves only one word amazing . Talentless child actor..check. Useless wife wearing modern make-up..check. Climbing the hill in armor...check. Cheesy fuckin' ass song in the background totally destroying any atmosphere the trailer might have..check. Bad CGI..and zero subtlety in a Vampire movie? Holy fucking shit. Bloddy razzie. I thought this movie was actually pretty good 'SUCH A BAD MOVIE,WASTE OF MY TIME.DID I MENTION...'WASTE'!!! OF MY TIME..I CAN'T BELIVE I HAD TO LOOSE AN EPISODE OF 'REGULAR SHOW' FOR THIS GARBAGE!!!..in fact if they do a sequel to this 'EXCUSE of VEMPIRE MOVIE, there'll be trouble!!!..THE NERVE OF THIS PEOPLE!..SUCH ARROGANCE HAVE THEY GOT NO RESPECT FOR PROFESSIONAL MOVIE LOVERS LIKE ME OFCOURSE. what a fucking G O D Do anybody now name of this song? Do anybody now name of this song? aminakodugum gavurlari Kain from Legacy of Kain, and Dracula Gabriel from Castlevania are the best Vampire lord to me! This was a good movie. It's true.....the Turkish will never conquer Europe! A great part of this movie is historically true. There was really a Romanian Prince, who fought against the Turkish. He was called the impaler,.....because he did, to impress and scared the TUrkish invaders. He won the battle with fewer man, and therefore the whole war. Afraid of his cruelty, the Turkish did not get any further into Europe. And by the way:  fuck Mehmed and all those Islamic Sultans! Muslims kill dracula We have the vampires here, now where are the werewolves?... cross with Underworld? ...
The Driller Killer Bloodstain 	New release of The Driller Killer out monday, which includes the rare 101 minute pre-release version of the film, plus loads of extras. Classic horror film Abe Ferrara looks a real cool guy. Very very creepy trailer! :/ Yogscast brought me here Here because of Duncan haha my dad told me about that movie. They actually did a pretty good job on this trailer. It captures the mood of the film really well and doesn't give away spoilers (like lots of other trailers I've seen for '70s movies). Very creepy trailer considering that it left out the blood. the silver skull braught me here the time this movie was made there wasn't battery drills...so when he was outside he had to find a plug first!!! I remember back in the 80s when I was a kid seeing an expose TV programme on video nasties and they showed the scene where he drills the winos head. I love these cheesy horror movies of the 80's there the best. Love to see a movie called Eat The Liberal, now that would be a good movie... KQRF KHANDS KLIXIONUM KILLER TECHNO AND NOISE UNIT Trailer just like the movie.....shit Then you should see a movie called "Eat The Rich". It is a British film about a restaurant where they murder rich people and serve the meat to other rich people.   good trailer  so thought that was blood not paint :p
Dummy 	What's the name of that puppet? amazing movie. Love this movie Adrien Brody is soo adorable and sweet in it, I just want to hug him. love love this movie..sooo underated!! Such an under-rated movie. Hilarious writing and a stellar cast. I want to see it again soon. Adrien has a cricked nose  I'M ON THER PHONE! Cute movie & Adrien is gorgeous & I believe did all the ventriloquism in this film. love his quirky movie.
Eagle's Wing 	Awesome movie. I'm with you on this one man. The end scene is iconic.
Elvis 	40+ years ago: "I have to get my music out there... Guess I'll head on over to this old building and put my voice on a round black shiny thing for only a few bucks, and actually get some radio play."Nowadays: "I have to get my music out there. Guess I'll download some software, make a demo, put it on a CD that I'll try to sell in a coffee shop, & maybe get some recognition. Or I can just play the ukulele in front of my webcam." Good story, bad movie. So that guy is Johnny cashes daddy and Elvis lol  Bet they didn't show that he was on drugs and stole music from black people.  Whoa, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley have the same daddy! LOL where was the heartbreak hotel part from? Elvis Presley - Lawdy, Miss Clawdy... :)  1980 That movie looks terribly sad and fucked up!  Long live the king of rock n roll RIP Elvis Aaron Presley Does anybody know where can I watch this movie? My native language isn't english, so if it's with subtitles (doesn't matter if they're english subtitles) that would be amazing! yeah i agree. It's Robert Patrick and he also plays Elvis in Lonely Street :) yup  I noticed that too. In one he plays a great dad who loves his son(Elvis) and in another he plays a verbally abusive man with nothing but disappointment in his son (Cash). Still interesting that he basically plays two opposite characters. Lawdy miss clawdy song at 2:40 please? the actor name is Robert Patrick & yeah it's pretty cool seeing him in both movies!! jonathan won a golden globe for this didn't he don't know if I can watch it. I can't get over how much he doesn't look, sound or resemble elvis at all. :/
Escape from Alcatraz 	this is cool Good movie Classic movie. still one of my favorite movies all the time Great movie, but the trailer's tone doesn't fit with the actual movie, the movie is very dark with its atmosphere and soundtrack. The Anglins reference? brilliant film of a true story Brilliant film great No Coment such a historical film. Up there with Scarface in my opinion Best Movie Ever what is he saying on 1.11? Is this film similar to "Escape Plan?" classic great movie, 10 out of 10 movie all day long. I like this movie alot...I guess the feeling about being trapped and then escape must be awesome This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Plus the fact that it was shot in my State of California, and in my most favorite city, San Francisco. I could watch this and The Shawskank Redemption over and over again. And believe me, I have.
Escape to Athena 	One of my all time favorites!!! Filmed in Rhodes. Outstanding locations indeed. Alright film, outstanding location Me la tengo que ver! classic film i loved this flick as a teen. Yes. I agree. Good old 60s/70s war movies! where the good guys can get into any Nazi base by wearing stolen uniforms (that always fit), where the vibe is less of a war film and more of a Bond film, and where period accuracy is for noobs!
The Europeans 	Imagine the possible grandeur of 21st century London, Paris, and Berlin today, even Stockholm and Oslo, if Europeans had only taken heed to the voice of Sir Oswald Mosley.The Resurrection draws near, with time line corrections brought about by new generations, this time paying attention.Hail Victory. You've got me checking your channel nearly every hour. Can't wait for this documentary, just in time for Christmas. Video not a available :( I've been a fan of these videos ever since you uploaded the first ones a couple of years ago - the video editing and sound combined with the choice excerpts of Sir Oswald speeches work incredibly well together. Like many I'd imagine I had my perceptions of the man  warped by the educational system and media here and yet the videos have inspired me into listening to his full speeches.  A hearty well done! Britain desperately needs the like of Moseley again if our people are to survive , the 'money power' who Oswald often spoke about seem to have an even tighter grip now on our country and continent. Britain and Europe are being invaded by the third world with the connivance of our governments  - native British are already a minority in London and it's heading that way in several other cities too. We in Britain are literally being ethically and demographically replaced by non-whites and the media demonises anyone pointing this out while at the same time covering up the epidemic of mass rape and grooming of young white girls a la Rotherham, Cologne, Sweden and a hundred other towns and cities. And that's without even getting into the influence of Frankfurt School and Cultural Marxism  in other areas of society  - schools of thought ultimately promoted by the same money power of international fi ce. It's good to see you're back. Visionary. May he rest in eternal peace Mosley lives in our Just CauseEurope for Europeans is the only Ethical AnswerEnd White Genocide I appreciate the expert edits, but we can never defeat our enemies by imitating them. Wrong message. OwO what's this? what music did you use for this? Oh cool. Love all your videos, I'm sure this will be epic.
The Evictors 	This reminds me of the amityville horror. still better then the strangers ""it happened in 1933... then it happened again" ....WHAT HAPPENED??? This film is on DVD actually Blu-Ray with a great Pierce film The a Town that Dreaded Sundown. it should be on the back of it. it says special bonus feature dvd only. thats what mine says. get the town that dreaded sundown bluray and dvd combo pack. and it has it on there. I actually found Boggy Creek 2 to be very entertaining  This movie is also on Netflix, if you'd like to know. Your loss. All of his stuff before Boggy Creek 2 are top notch. Man was a fucking auteur. Get ready. Shout! Factory's sub-label "Scream Factory" are releasing it next year on Blu-Ray/DVD. That music was used in Creature from Black Lake. Is it stock music, or was it composed for Creature? After seeing Boggy Creek 2 on MST3K, I'll try to avoid any of Chuckie Pierce's other films! I feel kind of dumb actually, it was like "it happened in 1933... then it happened again... and again" and I was just going "um... what's happening exactly?" I wuz evicted from my apartmint an that nevre hapened to me (xcept the rape part). This should be remade as "In Foreclosure."
Fast Break After 	when this came out in theaters, it later aired on CBS-TV in October 1980 I remember watching this movie several times as a kid in the early 1980s when it was on HBO.  I remember enjoying it a lot as a young boy who was into basketball. Mavis Washington is my PE teacher. That's insane!!! I loved this movie. Watched at Circle Theater in the Bronx.  Great movie! Thank you.
Fast Charlie... 	the Moonbeam Rider Great movie, thanks. first time I saw this movie at Cairo west airport Egypt back in November 1980 mildly amusing Love this movie! if you ask me i think he was murder in 2009, nice Love this movie, just watched it twice! thank you for posting this. ...haven't seen this since the early days of HBO,...when there was ONLY HBO. David Carradine, is one of my favorites, but I never knew about this movie.  It was very, very, good.
Firepower 	Hahahahha ARE YOU PROMOTING YOUR STAR..?RIK MARTINO RANKS AMONG THE BESTA CTORS OF ALL TIME...GLENN GREGORY/ANNA MARIA FIORE BIANCO MANAGER/AGENT/PUBLICIST323 850-8580 The trailer music is Bill Conti's theme to Five Days from Home (which opened three months earlier). So did Jackie Chan rip off the ending of the movie with bulldozer? I saw this in the theater. No actor today is as masculine as Coburn, no woman as exotic & beautiful as Loren, no one could play a cop as convincing as Gardenia. And O.J.? He killed his wife & is doing time in the big house, now that's tough, let's see the pretty boys of today do that. The 70s, if you weren't alive back then, then you wouldn't be able to survive those times if somehow you built a time machine & went back to the 70s which was still a possible concept in the 70s. Its how we rolled. "I don't kill people" - OJ Simpson I saw this ten years ago.  Complex plot, but splendid action as you'd expect from Winner.
The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh 	I loved this movie.
The Flame Is Love 	I collected the Barbara Cartland films and this is the only one I cannot get, are you able to share the whole film please, it looks terrific.
Flatbed Annie & Sweetiepie 	found movie today on Beta....fun...but some silly Kim Darby is the best and most beautiful actress Kim Darby is the best and most beautiful actress. I just bought this dvd on amazon!!! This is one of my favorite movies of all time!!! You can give me link this full movie? Tanks Is this how truck driving is? were can i get this movie on full movie ?
A Force of One 	take a shot every time he says force of one Doesn't everyone hear the silence and see the darkness? This is such a good film. These are the kinds of films that got me interested in the martial arts as a teenager back in the 80s. There's no digital nonsense or any of the computer generated bullshit, just real tough action by talented people. Great cult classic! "He hears the silence, he sees the darkness. He's the only one who can stop the killing." Bill "Superfoot" Wallace was great in this :) Love the part when he kicks the knife from that thug. Honestly,  there's no need to watch the movie after that.. It's like a Cliff's Notes version of the flick. :0) Awesome... good
Freedom Road 	mohamed ali he very respictable I've heard of this film until today when I read the tweet from AAIHS, can you upload the whole film?  Thanks Just spotted Ron "o Neal (of SUPERFLY fame) with that handlebar mustache! I've never understood why this film is rarely shown, or not even on DVD (as far as I know)  even though Ali starred in it (it was his only real acting role in a film.) Haven't seen this since it was first aired--would love to see it again. Did not know he played in a movie thanks. A fitting tribute.
French Postcards 	its supposed to be out on blu ray now with original score !
The Frisco Kid 	RIP Gene Wilder...one of my all time favorite movies HOWHAVEINEVERHEARDOFTHISMOVIEYEGODSINEEDTOSEETHIS!!! Is that Casey Kasem doing the voice over?
Gal Young Un Captain 	America doesn't stand a chance against her.. cant she fly because in new dc movies i never see her fly 12:11 This is crazy!! HEY guys, I F0und A Free WONDER WOMAN Necklace!!---  https://plus.google.com/u/0/116812079633518769101/posts/8xT7ghZV7bK 0:47 now i clarified this on how she put in back with sword stick butt This looks like historically false horse shit to me. Also craps on the 1930s comic book as well, the only people who are going to like this turd are DC fanboys. The Greek women in Sparta were really big into keeping slaves and so was most of Greek society, this hard on for making the Greeks all look like freedom loving people are full of shit. is better than other Gal Gadot Movie that she do Wonder Woman Trailer really blow my mind away the new style and the fight scene it was so amazing and cool before DC only make Batman And Superman ,  but now Wonder Woman show up and have her own Movie wow even i really thought she have her own movie at 2015 or early 90 because of Wonder Woman be a cameo in Batman VS Superman but i was wrong can't wait for this Movie . comes out on my b-day wait this trailer came last year ? I hope this feminist movie is better off than Ghostbusters. Called from where I from called slavery I really like her I like her lol this is no star wars trailer but 3k stormtroopers mistakenly hit the dislike button Themysicara looks BEAUTIFUL! This movie was filmed at Marina di Camerota's beaches (Italy), place where I live since 10 years ago!!! A real mediterranean paradise. This movie was filmed at Marina di Camerota's beaches (Italy), place where I live since 10 years ago!!! A real mediterranean paradise. Feminists not lie movie Google search super heroine movies, and see the WONDERFUL (not) selection us girls have. Lol, 99.99% of the movies that pop up feature nothing but male super hero's with you know 1 or 2 chicks in the background who have all of 10 seconds dedicated to them in the movie.I like seeing how powerful she is in this, but I'm worried it's going to just be a story about a man discovering a woman who has never seen a man before and ultimately pork her because she's the shiny prize. >_> BUT I hold my judgement until I see this movie. And I do hope in the future we can get more female focused super heroine movies. I mean it's sad that they STILL haven't made a black widow movie. that dress with the sword I wanted a Wonder Woman with black hair and blue eyes! Minor but, that's Wonder Woman.
Going in Style 	very funny :)) That bank is in gta 5 this movie is just like the korea films..i forgot the title Going in Style full movie https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A0DGELpxJGqlO1tW4-pI9RvKJUBAcAc-ldmiJ91s_8U/edit?usp=sharing Good movie! This was a horrible movie I've seen it, it's so funny when you chose Deathwish in GTA5 so the 3 of them grew up old just to have a movie made of them It always should've been Luke and not Chase ... My school (sophomores and seniors) watched this movie today because freshmen and juniors were taking the "staar test". And because this one guy at our community college was killed, so they thought we needed a stress relieving day by letting us watch either this or another (old) movie. But the principle didn't know what this was about. It features smoking weed, sex, and a lot of cussing. The movie was freaking awesome. Fun with Dick & Jane 2 create your own brand,,,,]free subscription https://storage.cloud.google.com/onllinebusiness/e-commerce.html I don't know why but I feel like Skatler and Waldorf should be in this movie. Good movie. The best movie morgen freeman been in 10/10 FUCK ME- WHAT A BUNCH OF SHIT.. Just an exact copy of the '1979' movie with same title "Going in style"....

Gold of the Amazon Women 	And? yes, it is :)  Retarded Footage is very good quality. I didn't know this movie even existed. Looks like some B-grade made for TV film. Those Amazon women are hot. Pity the gassing scene is so bad that its funny. @mangog3000 funny and Hot! :)  I remember this movie! Fun KO scene!

HealtH 	the soundtrack to this trailer is really distracting and obnoxious Every vegan film and vegan preaching probably should remind everybody at the beginning and at the end that vegan diets require vitamin b12 supplement. Arsenic also causes cancer and is quite high in rice. Dr Michael Greger (employee of vegan organization) and ethical vegan nutritionist Brenda Davis have already started to discourage people from eating rice. Plant foods can also have carcinogens such as mycotoxins like aflatoxin. Chiropractor Alan Goldhamer promotes a no gluten diet to everyone which is unfortunately not supported by science. Dr Michael Greger's grandmother's heart disease was reversed on the low fat unrefined foods starch staple based pritikin diet which does include a small amount of animal products to avoid the need for vitamin b12 supplement. Vegan Dr Milton Mills is obese and should probably cut down on refined substances like oil, and fatty vegan foods like nuts, seeds, avocado. Dr Milton Mills should probably cut down on vegan junk food like cakes. Dr Neal Barnard is a pro vegan (ethical vegan) doctor and is founder of the pro vegan organization PCRM (physicians committee for responsible medicine) and his theories about the origin of diabetes probably need more studies to verify. I have heard from Christopher Gardner that any excess fat, carb and protein will be converted to body fat and being overweight is indeed linked to diabetes. Most animal products are loaded with fat so eating excessive animal products like what most americans are doing will cause obesity and diabetes. When america started, americans only ate animal products once a day which increased to 2x a day and 3x a day as americans became richer and the addiction to fossil fuels made animal products cheaper. It is much easier to overeat on refined substances like oil, sweeteners, juice, refined white flour, protein powder. For plant foods, to avoid creating carcinogens, better to use cooking methods like steaming and boiling instead of high heat dry cooking like roasting and baking. Nutritionist Susan Levin (an ethical vegan) is employed by the pro vegan group PCRM. Mainstream science of the 2015 diet guide for americans still supports low fat dairy, non fat dairy and maybe weekly seafood (daily seafood is not a good idea bec of pollution like mercury, oceans and land also have radioactive particles). Both the pritikin program and Dr dean ornish program are recognized by medicare. Pritikin diet (low fat unrefined plant based, starch staple based) allows a small amount of animal products to avoid the need for vitamin b12 supplement. Dr dean ornish diet (low fat unrefined plant based, starch staple based) allows egg whites, non fat dairy and fish oil epa/dha supplement. Misuse of antibiotics in livestock in super crowded factory farms is a source of deadly antibiotic resistant bacteria found in raw meat and in hospitals. My younger sister died from hospital bacteria in 1992. There is no evidence gmo crops cause health problems in people. There is not much evidence linking dairy to diseases altho half of the human species are lactose intolerant so dairy is obviously not for everyone. MyPlate dairy group does allow vegan milks. MyPlate protein group allows for beans, peas and lentils so just take vitamin b12 supplement for the vegan healthy eating pattern. MyPlate grains group should probably offer alternative cheap starch staple foods like tubers (like sweet potato and potato), winter squash (can chew on the seeds), unripe plantain. Vegans also need exercise, sunshine (vitamin d) and calcium from plant foods to avoid fractures. Dairy causing cancer is not yet accepted by mainstream science. Many blue zones with longevity do consume some dairy such as in the mediterranean islands. Not all addiction is bad since life is also an addiction. The government CDC has a free PreventT2 curriculum and handouts (free pdf files) to educate people on preventing diabetes based on a study of people who already had prediabetes (lifestyle changes vs metformin). The PreventT2 curriculum and handouts probably should emphasize a vegan option via vitamin b12 supplement, protein group (beans, peas, lentils) and vegan milks. The ADA does have a prevent diabetes diet but they do not offer a vegan option via vitamin b12 supplement, protein group (beans, peas, lentils) and vegan milks similar to the 2015 diet guide for americans. The 2015 diet guide for americans is not too bad bec it now promotes healthy eating patterns like dash diet, mediterranean diet, vegetarian diet and vegan diet with vitamin b12 supplement. Mainstream science also agrees vegan diet with vitamin b12 supplement is best for the environment but the politicians prevented environmental considerations to be included in the 2015 diet guide for americans. It requires more than 1 vegan study to convince the ADA and the mainstream. According to Christopher Gardner, every plant has all of the essential amino acids (complete protein). After the fall of the dinosaurs, apes evolved from small insectivores and the apes had larger bodies and had to get more calories from plants but they never really gave up eating some insects. All indigenous people probably still eat some insects. People are technically omnivores. The genetic adaptations for eating animal products is not easily seen in  our bodies bec we were using tools (and later cooking) after we came down from the trees. After coming down from trees, we also had genetic adaptations for digging and eating more roots and tubers. About half of the tubers in africa can be eaten raw and cooking was discovered later. Most of us are descended from agriculture groups that have genetic adaptations for eating lots of unrefined starch staple foods like whole grains and tubers. A few human groups do have genetic adaptations for eating large amounts of fatty animals such as the Inuit. About half of humans have genetic adaptations to consume dairy. The Alan Goldhamer diet being used at Truenorth Health Center is a no salt diet (also no oil, no sweeteners altho they use juice and juice is also a processed food). The Alan Goldhamer diet favors cheap starch staples of tubers like sweet potato. High salt is also linked to high blood pressure, strokes and stomach cancer. Using plant based diet to cure cancer can be risky as Steve Jobs found out. I heard Steve Jobs tried water only fasting, juicing, and also macrobiotic diet (a type of plant based diet where the starch staple is brown rice). Most plant based evangelists admit they cannot cure pancreas cancer. Some terminal cancer patients have managed to live slightly longer on a plant based diet than what the doctors predicted. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics does approve of vegetarian diets and vegan diets (plus vitamin b12 supplement) and they have a vegetarian diets position paper from 2016 (one of the authors is ethical vegan nutritionist Susan Levin who is an employee of the pro vegan group PCRM, another author belongs to the pro vegan religion seventh day adventists, a third author writes vegan books). I have seen countless food and pharmaceutical documentaries, this is one of the best! This video was created by an uneducated idiot supported by a bunch of anorectic vegans. But they left Calcium undiscussed. I became vegan, highly recommend anyone who wants to live without meds. they lost my interest when they said chicken is bad...like what the fuck,how are you supposed to get protien???from plants???/man has been a hunter since long and no they say meat is bad... Hi, would it be possible to get a list of the peer-reviewed evidence presented in this movie? Yawn. What overproduced, overly dramatic schlock. Everyone knows how to be healthy, it's nothing revolutionary. More vegan circle jerking is all I'm seeing here SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE SONG THAT PLAYS AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENTARY DURING THE CREDITS!!!!(btw, amazing documentary. Very informative and I want to share with my family!!) This documentary is brilliant and will help so many people! I wish this was free to watch, because really i can't afford it, but I guess it's pretty much what we all know already It doesn't say a release date or if it will be free on youtube or hosted on netflix or anything. Can we get more information about this? I know all about this - big corporations will always put profit before people and it  moves me to despair. I just don't buy their products. That fossil from the ADA likely has type 2 diabetes. Just sayin'."EVERY DIET WURKS LEL" Yay more poorly researched once sided vegan propaganda featuring the usual suspects. You suck! The people in power are mentally ill. I am not religious but I believe they are luciferians who believe in weird stuff so they dont think they are doing wrong. Groundbreaking
H.O.T.S. 	Ban Lucio, i'll take malfurion. GG ez man it took them FOUR years to finally give us the Diablo skin from the trailer. feels bad man =( oh come one  diablo prime would devour raynor First In regards to everyone saying this isn't how it should've gone down. I'm almost 100% in all MOBAs they all emphasize how every single character is weakened to make them all the near level of strength, speed, etc., it's all about skill, which is why Nova could take out Arthas. Maybe they should let Nova fight Sargeras after all. Glad they finally put the skin Diablo is wearing in the cinematic into the game. Took too long blizzard! Glad they finally put the skin Diablo is wearing in the cinematic into the game. Took too long blizzard! 1:49 Detected what?? in cinamatic blizzard make artheus look badass but in-game it you know agggghhhhhh!!!,they should make this video called: "try not to cringe chalange" "No one nukes the Prime Evil and gets away with it!"- Diablo (Diablo 3 Form) WHOS THAT SNIPER!`!?? whats her name? Great trailer, bad game come out come out wherever you are can I have the sound track please? We now finally have a Prime Evil Diablo skin. That Diablo skin just now came out. Quick question: Is that demon supposed to be Diablo? The reason why I ask is because he looks very different in the game, at least right now.The game is very good. I like Arthas, but I usually play as Morales. still, after so long, l still don't get how Frostmourn can't break a rifle.....
Hair 	Looks too much of a hippie film for me. Wayne from Sydney, Australia. Totally underrated movie.   Stunning soundtrack. love this movieeee like if Rooster Teeth "On The Spot 12" sent you here Favorite movie since i was 7 yearls old Actually, the trailer is consistent with the style of the movie. If u have ever studied film, particularly German Expressionism, you will see why this trailer is an appropriate one; a seeming hodge podge of images, which forces the viewer to fill in the blanks...and that is exactly the way the film is presented...not sure if you were being sarcastic, but educate yourself, and maybe you'd have a different response. ahhhhh this film. i love it so much! This is one of my favorite movies! Weirdest movie i've seen but intresting... My god, I love everything about the 80's except the format of the trailers back then... Fantastisch Preciosa y gran bso :D The best. Wow. This just tells sooo much about the movie... es realmente hermosa esta pelicula, muy hermosa. LOVE it!
Hanging by a Thread 	Beautiful, ominous. I will never forget seeing it at the Little Angel Theatre.
Hardcore 	Since you were put into the character's head, it could have expanded on his thoughts he keeps to himself or where he draws the line on the level of humor and seriousness. Beyond amazing! Anyone know the movie that is kind of pov zombie movie i cant remember it its like you've been attacked by a weird wheelchair mutant dog shit? you're like in a some red room. howtobasic + Call Of Duty + Doom = THIS If  you like this type of video, go to see my channel, I make many movie like that ;) While this movie DEFINITELY didn't do well in the box office, it was definitely unique. Name ONE other movie that's presented in the First Person Perspective FUCKING AWSOME Best movie ever the rooftop clone scene... such left4dead vibes. at 2:23...he did not do the okay sign to the city in the movie This game will only run with a NVIDIA TITAN Xp graphics card! First person shooter? I really want more movies in first person. Not found footage, I mean LITERALLY first person. The movie was good Texnolyze anyone? good Watched it with my dad. Bad-ass film ! Doom intro really reminds me of the intro to this EZ Fucking awesome!
Saturn 3 	I love how perfect this description is. What disturbed me a lot about this movie was the end scene. You thought that he had survived his ordeal only to see that he had an AI plug in socket installed in the back of his neck / head meaning that the robot won in the end. The fight between man and machine goes on. I watch the trailer for Moontrap just once and now my feed is full of trailers for obscure Sci-Fi thriller/horror films i came here from the big bang theory 0:01 0:35 older brother of T-600 Movie is crap by critics, but i have been fascinated in my childhood. It was one of my favourite sci-fi movies :) I saw this on USA a looong time ago and couldn't stop watching it. The scene where she gets glass in her eye still puts me on edge just remembering it. I wonder if Cameron was inspired by this mess. Looks pretty bad but still better than a lot of today's cgi rubbish. This is my partner? 1:15 If there is only 4 inhabitants, LOL, the least thing you want her to be is your fucking partner Not as good as "Saturn 2" It was an about 1985 in polish tv I remember and I was 5 years old watching with my grandfather and I was so glad that I watch this thill the end because they killed this robot at the end. This gives  my a lot off relive that is dead and he doesn't come too kill us at night he he :) . Today I'm 35 years old and still remember. Very good movie and awesome memories from does days. I wonder if Saturn and Saturn 2 were just as shit as Saturn 3. "shadowlock"... AKA "shadow". It looks so laughable now, but this movie scared the crap out of me when I was a kid!I see from the other comments that I was not alone at having nightmares after having watched it! :  ) Farrah should have done alien holy shit....i'm totally BUYING THIS! As cheesy as the effects are, this film is NEVER boring. It makes for an enjoyable viewing experience. Ignore the critics. This movie is an escape from the daily grind! Captain Kirk Douglas!!
Home Movies 	Not surprising. Two sick dykes that deny God, amd wonder why they have problems. What a movie I love horror movies, especially "found footage" movies, but I think I will have to skip this one...just because of the cat! Quick my kitties, HIDE YOUR EYES! I just want to share with you that the movie is available in high quality on dvd from Amazon this movie is complete in my channel!!! That happend when parents say to their children clean your room xD So what's so scary about this movie? what's so scary about these kids? awesome film Where can I find this? Where can i watch this movie ??? I seriously wanna see it  There's a lotta better movies out there. But I been onna horror binge for the last month and I'M like scraping the bottom of the barrel of unseen movies to see. And i'm at the point where I WISH half the movies I'm coming across was AT LEAST as good as this move. I watched this film weeks ago and what i remember most was questioning whether the supernatural element was real or not. At one level I wish the film was more explicit. But on another, the film really wasn't about that. It was about "The Jack and Emily Show" taking over lives of everyone in the house. i do not condone child abuse, but if my kids pulled a psychotic stunt like this, i would beat the shit out of them. Reminds me of Sinister. Just the kids killing the parents part only. The rest of the movie is trash!! I might check it out. I won't say the movie was horrible but it was subpar. Challenge accepted. I wouldnt dare to watch your movie, cause it SUCKS! XD that's the last fucking time i babysit
Hot Stuff 	A great, simple "good-time" comedy I grew up on in the early '80s, the kind they don't make anymore. It's sad that the whole main cast has since passed away in the last number of years (we just lost Luis Avalos in January 2014). great klassik movie!!!!
Hot T-Shirts 	Works for me! IMPACT ACTION ON DEMAND..Elements Of Action Include: Gg-Groovey Grindin, Ha-Hoosin Around, Cc-Coed Cheerleaders & a Ws-Whipcream Strike!!!!! Does anyone know where to find this sound track!!!  Ive looked everywhere!  Torrent sites and everything you name it.  Anyone know?  I found that its performed by Jerri Palmer but thats all I got.  :(  tig ole biddies This movie's on Netflix right now- not the greatest movie I've ever seen but it's certainly worth checking out. I'd buy the soundtrack album if there was one. Great music!!! Damn
The House on Garibaldi Street 	SORRY POSTING SAYS "FULL MOVIE" AND ITS JUST THE TRAILER - LOVE THIS MOVIE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE ENTIRE MOVIE POSTED.   THANKS! If you have this trailer, which by the way is incredible, do you have access to the entire film? If you do what a gem. Post it! Thanks!
Hurricane 	I thought I've seen Malcolm Jamal Warner in this Trailer but Malcolm looks nothing like that during 1999. Great movie. Uploader, you should've included the year in the title or description. I love The Hurricane and this is one of my favorite based on a true story movies i have ever seen . Denzel Washington nailed the role of Rubin '' The Hurricane '' Carter and he did a fantastic performance :) . Clancy Brown was great too in the movie . It may have been based on a true story but there were so many inaccuracies that it really tarnished what could have been a great movie. one hell of a performance If you didn't already know the story, then seeing the title would be kind of misleading. At first, you'd think it's some sort of disaster thriller about a hurricane engulfing the city, but no, it's a prison drama about a real-life wrestler who was arrested falsely and let out purely by the love of a foster family. Great story, though! this is a story to remember! a wonderful movie :) stupendo.. the best!!!! Thats cool thanks for watching full movie in 2 min... It's pretty cool that the music from The Shawshank Redemption was used in the trailer 2:00 black walter white R.I.P R.I.P MR CARTER <3 Awesome movie. RIP Ruben Carter
The In-Laws 	Nothing like the CIA, though.  No drugs, arms, nor slave running. The gay gangster boss is the greatest character ever, right with the killer in 'no country for old men.' Exceptional. I love Albert Brooks!  I'd like to marry him for being such a hilarious, neurotic, dork! fuckin cunt bags, i love youtube, and this movie
The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel 	My dad and our horses brought "Meg" into town. Pretty cool. This movie was filmed on location in Nevada County, California. I think she's probably making more money selling beds instead of acting.  Plus she seems to be more interested in her spiritual side at this point than a full-fledged acting career.  Really odd fact:  Linda Gray used to be Lindsay Wagner's aunt. That's the first thing I thought when I saw the series.  A rip-off of the movie.  They even had Jane Wyman in a very early episode.  I thought the TV movie was so good, especially being a "Bionic Woman" fan as a kid.  She really knows how to do drama.  I wish she was on TV again. and it all started to go downhil since the 1990'sand if you think jersey shore and kardashians were bad enought, they are dynasty and melrose compared to even worse one now here comes honey boo boo, extremely, extremely awful, the worst one ever. Add some kids and change her name to Quinn.   I miss the glory days of TV movies.Now it's all shit thanks to Jersey Shore and the goddamn Kardashians.
Jack Frost 	esa pelicula es hermozaa esa pelicula es hermozaa im watching this right now on my VCR.... somebody  threw out a bunch of VHS tapes in the garbage and i swooped in to rescue them.....now im watching this movie RIGHT now. good lord... what a dumb movie. this movie isnt magical or funny. the actors tried wayyyy to hard. and the boy actor overly-acted. i didnt cry or did i smile. i may of chuckled at one or two scenes but the rest of the movie SUCKS. well so i did some research and googled the movies reviews from rotten tomatoes. i was right to think it sucked. so many critics also thought the same thing i thought. i guess we all think the same. i rate this movie a 2 out of 10. dont even bother renting it on youtube. youve been warned Jackfrost was not a snowman he was a human being i LOATHE jack frost The snowman here is better animated than the horror version I love this movie I cant wait till Christmas Bc I peeled to the presents and I'm going to get jack frost hollauya I give this movie a two and a half out of 5 ,kinda slow but picked up big time when he turned into a snowman .OK movie won't watch it again Boy plays harmonica and summons his father's soul back from Hell RIP Jack Frost!  i love this movie I watch it every year. plus I bought the DVD the other day so I can watch anytime I want love love love this movie. if I could put crying in words I would I am so happy for that little boy to get a second chance with His father 1998??1980. Ah darn - I thought this was the trailer for the one where the snowman rapes a woman in the shower with a carrot. Did u just butt dad me by the way that would make you butt boy lol
Jaguar 	Lives! I'm pumped! When is it coming out?  0:02 take that religion! Its being shown on malaysia TV tonight! Wheee!!! RIP Grandmaster Lewis. You were one of he legends for sure. I have this Movie Great Entertainment,R.I.P Joe Lewis Champion! Everyone say a prayer in your hearts for Joe Lewis..he's in hospice care. When Chuck Norris goes to sleep at night he checks under his bed for Joe Lewis ...
The Jericho Mile 	I wonder why he broke his stopwatch at the end.  Weird. My favorite tv movie growing up! The building I live in has long hallways. Anyway, the other day I was watching this and it hyped me up so much I grabbed my roomies Note 4 and started the timer. I took off out the door and ran the corridor as fast as I could and when I was about 15 feet from the door at the end of the hall I threw the Note 4. It smashed to bits. My roomie and I looked at each other and we had a good laugh. amazing! why did he throw the stopwatch at the prison wall?he wanted to see time fly.sorry, couldn't resist ;p strauss did a good job in this. Still get's me going. If you ever raced, this is it. Director Michael Mann followed this brilliant TV film with one of the finest crime films of the '80s "Thief," starring James Caan and featuring a small, Oscar-worthy supporting performance from Willie Nelson. I had this movie on BETA!!! Great film, worst stride for a miler ever:) Just one of those great scenes that you will always remember. Ok... most of you are close. He had a chance to compete. The board asked him, if he felt remorse--he said same circumstance he would kill his father again. The board elected to keep him incarcerated. But he did beat Davies time, and this movie is just plain inspirational. This scene inspires me more than Rocky, not to run mind you--just to get the F up and do it. Finally running again after a injury laid me low and I put on a lot of weight,,now 6 stone lighter I'm running again....slower than a 3 legged donkey...but moving forward. awesome clip from an awesome movie. I needed inspiration to get off my ass and try a 5k.  I know there will be a lot of pain endured as I train but this vid is definitely inspirational.  When my body is ready to quit i'll just envision the Jericho mile Great Movie. Watched it as a Teenager....but even back then I was thinking....he could have shaved off a few seconds without the wind resistance of his flowing locks
The Jesus Film 	Thank u and i enjoyed the film
Kramer vs. Kramer 	They need to not show that photograph every 5 seconds. I brought this on dvd in a hospital would you believe lol. Great non-cheesy trailer. Billy don't like Salisbury steak and he likes to eat ice cream , Billy cries all the time and he really wants his mommy One of the best movies of all time. Kramer vs Kramer is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. It shows you the ends and outs of two people who are fighting for this little boy that they loved very much but also trying to find who they are without each other. The main characters and the supporting characters are wonderful in this movie. This is really a good movie to see if you are going through a divorce. O raid this movie looks terrible! -_- 0:32 - Charlie Babbit made a joke.Yeah. That's a HORRIBLE trailer for this movie. Lol it deserves so much better! For anyone who has kids you recognise every moment.  Those who dont..just wait and enjoy. I definitely have to watch more of Hoffmann now after watching that flick. Meryl Streep does a good performance but she's not at her best by far. I'm sure this film was only made to illustrate a point. <3 Why are there so many derogatory comments about women here ("cunty" "bitch" "typical woman") because Meryl Streep's character wanted a divorce? Why is a woman a "bitch" if she wants a divorce? Is a guy a "faggot" when he wants a divorce? Don't get married in the first place if you don't actually love the person... Amazing Plese uploded full movie love hoffman's voice Typical woman. SMH
The Lady Vanishes 	i just finished the book and i can't wait to watch the 3 remakes of this xD You know you have created something good when remakes are made of it 65 years later Beautiful cast and excellent, English drama. It all looks very good and should be very enjoyable. As for Tuppence Middleton, wow! I loved the Hitchcock from the '30's. I wish I could see this version! Will some kind person upload it for a poor, BBC drama deprived Yank? I hate it when people accuse argumentative people on the internet for having "no life" or are maybe lacking something. Maybe you just really pissed them of and said something I enjoyed it while I was watching it, but I don't think (unlike the original) I'll watch it again. The main character annoyed me a little, but then I think she was supposed to. And it did feel a little rushed on the train at the end. But over all good Saturday night drama, if a little fluffy. But the kind of thing which I would be very happy to see on the BBC every week.  Well if that's the case, I note your apology. Your brother sounds like a pain You're right. I was just so shocked by the vitriol after a simple innocent request/remark from me regarding the novel's reissue. I do ultimately feel rather sorry for people who feel the need to attack people online as clearly there's something lacking in their real life. Looks like his posts have received a lot of thumbs down/flags for spam anyway. I did enjoy it yes, it was a nice adaptation of the book, but I still prefer the '38 film. I also caught the 79 remake again on Film4 yesterday too u shouldn't be the one apologising. I don't blame you for your reaction. There was no need for the hate you faced just asking about a book's publication bear pits. true indeed I liked it. Agreed it isn't Hitchcock's film, but then it wasn't supposed to be. As a fan of the novel too I was happy to see a faithful version to that. Nice light Sunday night tele as you say. Shame Nick-whatever his name is can't accept that and felt the need to rant at peeps sorry to hear that, I can understand why some people such as yourself leave. The comments sections on videos are like bear pits these days; a way for impotent people to vent their anger with relative security. That said, apologies if anything I say has offended you. It wasn't directed at anyone but the person who started the attacks against me what did u think of it anyway? True, but I think DD has rightly defended himself. I've just rejoined youtube after similar nightmares. Ppl need to stand up to trolls taking personal attacks against users just cos they happen to not like something Oh yw So true! Anyway, I really enjoyed this precisely because it stayed so truthful to Ethel Lina White's novel. OK, Launder&Gilliat wrote a great screenplay, but it was so refreshing to see an adaptation utterly faithful with the characters behaving exactly as they did in the book. The film looked lavish and beautiful and the cast were great. Shame some people can't accept any variation out there and instead resort to attacking ppl for no good reason.  I know. I hate how Youtube videos are ruined for the majority by people with poor social skills looking for fights that in some way make them feel better about themselves rather than addressing the clear issues they have in reality Thank you wasn't it? :)
The Lady in Red 	I love this movie can't seem to find the whole thing! Love the crew trailers in the background at 2:03 during the car wreck... they had nudity in trailers back then? i haven't seen this movie since the 20th century. Thinking the same thing. They pretty much show the whole movie in this preview. Pamela Sue really was an awesome actress. She hit the big time with Dynasty, and left Hollywood behind at the pinnacle of her acting career. I give her cudos for this, but her fans lost so much! Anybody know if this is on dvd? 0:31 first time in my life that i was looking for a movie and for mistake i saw boobs.... and the cute hairy little friend. i saw this when i was little. i remember how gritty and disturbing it was. Is this really the offical trailer?  go to 30 seconds in, this is a movie from the 70's.. I wouldnt think that it would be allowed, for them too put that in great movie,man... Good movie. Back in 1998 I couldn't sleep. I kept channel surfing. I was attracted to the actress & the movie. I saw the last 30 minutes. I didn't know the name of the movie at the time. I finally found out & looked allover the place to get a copy. I saw the whole film. I felt bad for her in a way b/c she came from an abusive home. In real life her name was Polly Hamilton. I think she died in the 60's and was married to a traveling salesman. Much isn't known about her b/c she kept a low profile. 31 to 33 seconds, best part of the film. 31 to 33 minutes, best part of the film. underrated movie....better than Public Enemies....more violent and disturbing :) Doc went back to the 1930's! Dick Miller was in everything...jeez
A Last Cry for Help 	Yes! Been looking for this one for a while now. Thanks! Thank you! I've been looking for this movie! Linda Purl was so sweet and pretty. Very sad movie. What a bitch mother to just take that dog to the pound to be gassed. Surely they had euthanasia back then at a vet's office. To not even let her say goodbye is unforgivable! The Bee Gees beach party is awesome.   Followed by Steve Miller ;)   Yeah.. Fleetwood Mac's Dreams at 18:18.  I'm a 70s kid, so I love this music!  Eddie Money Baby Hold On.  James Taylor Handy Man.  Linda Purl is excellent "I want to be important to someone".  Every person's journey is uniquely their own.. no other human ever really "shares" in it.   Spoiler:  The art teacher is wrong.. she should be able to express her sadness through art.  Mom should have let Sharon be there when Buttons was put down.  My parents let me hold my cat, and it did help me let him go. Grant Goodeve from Eight is Enough. And Linda Ronstadt. Love Linda Purl! I miss the TV movie of the week .they were very dramatic and had top notch acting. This is still a gem. Linda pural is awesome as the troubled teen. Thanks for posting this
The Last Ride of the Dalton Gang 	good film Do you have The Long Ride ? Cool since I like old westerns & never seen this one but what does this have to do with VH?
The Last of the Blue Devils 	"Swing for me, cousin."Thanks so much for posting this! Thanks for posting, very informative and stunning musicians ;) My mother made a video of this -god bless her. I grew up in a two up two down slum in MManchester. My mother played the piano for our entertainment. I'm in raptures when I here this music- I'm in our living room aged 10 again. Roll on those ivories. the greatest musical of all time BIG JOE TURNER IS THE REAL THING. Not that Buddy Guy, BB King, Elmore James Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf and all the more recent guys are not. But when I hear Joe I hear something akin to the voice of god - powerful, sublime with an unquestioned authority. Beautiful. thanks ever so much. Saw the film years ago, feels like yesterday Wow.Big Joe Turner.Wow. This is wonderful. Thanks to Clint Eastwood, this great documentary was rescued from obscurity (????) and re-mastered on a brilliant DVD.   Brilliant!  Warms the heart and moves the blood! Wonderful. Thanks for posting this.
The Legacy 	When is the 3rd season coming out?
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow 	This movie scared the shit out of my childhood! The cinematography and art direction is still the best i've ever seen in a film.  The black and white and grey's mixed with the bright red is amazing.  I love the costume design and the set designs and the great use of light and fog for sure the most underrated tim burton movie i love this movie gonna watch this for the first time ever. in 2017! a good film :) Who else thinks that the headless horseman was the scariest fucking thing you'd ever seen when you were younger?! I like Christina Ricci. She never gets mentioned with the "stars" of the 90s and 00s. Cursed was a decent flick. Maybe it's the forehead. I always thought she was gorgeous. But....what do I know. I wanna see it really bad 2017 I was a little frustrated cause Katrina and Ichabod didn't kiss.. Nazgul are back fuck me Johnny. Such a good film. It's a nice looking film and the Headless Horsemen is cool but I didn't particularly care for any of the characters and the story didn't grip me. I understand why it has fans, but I don't see myself watching it again. From which period is this film inspired? I play  Bloodboure so it helps Johnny's weak ass Johnny is a weird FUCK. This movie wasn't that bad though when you have to watch a trailer to watch a trailer
Life of Brian 	Is that Morgan Freeman's voice I hear? *** Get the adderall on abc I**** Anc filmmaking** abc Briab: crucifucation Brian on abc Hate is god on abc 1997 Abc You cant help on abc Occupy wallstreey on abc Abc life of brian: 32 1984 on Abc Bridgeport, c.t. This movie film was amazing, great work! So much better then the shit being made today. As usual Jews "hell customers" are  behind "all I said was that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah" Terry Jones brought a lot of joy and laughter to my life... I hope he finds a lot of love and support. Dementia sucks, but this man is a legend still alive. Lordfriki.... For those that didn't get it, Bryan is actually Jesus. Best quote in any movie "He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy"
A Little Romance 	i loved the film soo much Nunca pude olvidarme de este film, fue uno de mis favoritos junto con "Melody", que bellas epocas !! Beautiful Movie
Long Weekend 	good movie All they did in this remake was shine a light on the last victims before them but they still haven't explained why the beach appears cursed nor their actions making them a target What was that a beached whale ? IM AMAZED OF THE RETARDED COMMENTS IN CAPITAL LETTERS. I UNDERSTOOD THIS MOVIE, ENDING COULD BE BETTER I DIDNT UNDERSTAND MOVIE,HATE UNACCOUTABLY ENDING

Love at First Bite 	BEST MOVIE--LOVE GEORGE HAMILTON. ArteJohnson was very funny !!!!! Great cast I always liked this movie Can George Hamilton be any sexier?? I LOVE this movie. I remember waiting all day to see this movie in the city. I even slept under a tree in the park because I was so tired from all the shift work but I wanted to see this movie and it was well worth it. I loved it! I've really enjoyed this one when I was a kid. The man with the tan playing the ghoul of the night. Works for me! Thank you for sharing! Great movie! I liked movies in the eighties, because they were fun. Too bad no upload, great movie and George is the best in it!  I always watched this movie when growing up.They don't make movies like this anymore.  It's a damn shame. The best spoof about Vampire/Dracula movies I have ever seen. The Disco music/song is FABULOUS. This movie gave me a idea for a great book. Thank you. :) This movie was not scary at all, it was funny as hell and I was 10 when I saw it at the drive-in (remember those?), lol!! I just love the 70s fire extiguisher special effect at 0:22 back then this was a scary movie, but today its a comedy :)
Mad Max 	I want to live Australia. Was it explained why Max's family had been changed like he had a baby boy in Mad Max 79 but in Fury Road its a daughter possibly age 8. Is it not meant to be his family but maybe a new family but lost them too or maybe people he failed to save. Or is it an alternate timeline. Australia is boss like madmax Maad Max: Fury Road movie heeeere => https://twitter.com/b9673508732f7f9d2/status/861408329972686848 just CGI and effects cheap, my all time favorite is Mad Max2 - Road Warrior,  even the 3 Beyond Thunderdome is better than this. With a talent like Hardy, you don't need all that special effects shit. Australia Total shit supported by graphics. Come back Mel Gibson. Very bad film... More like MAX the pussy cat dominated by women and ugly too. MAD MAX FURY ROAD>ENTIRE FAST AND FURIOUS FRANCHISE. *EPIC* srulAD DADET RA Does anybody know the name of the song that starts at 1:30? Better title for this movie:Mad Max: White KnightOne sole (not too bright) man risks his life and opposes the natural order of gender relations by robbing the local government of its main utility for both reproduction and gratification, thereby proving his worth to a butch tomboyish feminist who acts as the de facto main character of the entire film. Rejoice! Not as good as San Andreas. fucking. cool Who would've thought this was actually going to be one of the best damn action movies ever made. this movie makes no sense at all This should be turned into a anime
The Main Event 	An angel, plain and simple. jewish cunt, fuck off to mexico In other words Barbara Streisand saw Rocky and said lets do a romantic comedy like that. love those days of film..great movie!
Malibu High 	heinously dreadful....one of quentin tarantino's favorite movies im guessing she was Valedictorian her senior year? Oh how I remember this TERRIBLE movie from my early teen years. It was awful then, & has only worsened over the years.  I LOVE IT!
A Man, a Woman and a Bank 	a hidden gem, one of the best heist films I've ever seen. Terrific movie.
Manhattan Fun 	fact. Woody Allen HATED this movie and begged the studio to get rid of the entire film and let him make a different one. No joke. Lucky for him and the studio they refused. And  the rest is history. Could anyone tell me please what exactly Allen says at the very end, after the other guy's reproach? Cinematography and score amazing! ONE OF MY VERY FAVOURITE  WOODY ALLEN FILMS EVER!
Mary and Joseph 	Joseph And Mary are oriental, not occidental. Surprisingly good, give it a go! Saint Joseph please intercede for me. Joseph was 90 that peso. can't wait for it! Looking forward to seeing the Bible Reloaded review this travesty. So no one memorized the script and on $2 budget a Movie was made, Congrats this may be the Best movie ever made on $2.
Meatballs 	Who have got the game "Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"? FLDSMDFR has created very big disasterPeople on Swallow Falls objective:- Survive the disasters Es Teaser No Trailer #1 He is best What song is that on 1:42? Love this movie! :D When this actually happened,I will only lay on ny rooftop all day waiting for food to fall in your mouth. 1:39 mama mia XDXDXDXD mario XD Downvoted for no captions I want to look at the full movie not this but thanks I gess ;/ My favourite anime!!!! is I feel old As fk, 7 years ago wow.... I'll show this to a starving African child. Who remembers when this came out? 1:17 to 1:34 What is the Music called again?, cause I love this music :D when he is big he is ugly 7 years ago you got to be kidding me FLINT LOCKWOOD!
Meteor 	AIP took a huge risk making this bigger budget (for AIP) sci-fi/disaster hybrid film. The film bombed at the box office and AIP soon was out of business. Ya, Meteor was ....s....l....o....w.... as molasses. And if anyone here knows anything about Natalie Wood, you would know that she didn't have to go far, to get a Russian accent. look at the Superman fonts A Movie in a Trailer, awweeesome. I didnt have watch at all. Deep Impact and Armageddon were a definite improvement, but CGI had taken a huge leap to improve the tension and the destruction. Morgan Freeman replaces Henry Fonda as President in Deep Impact. Love  these cheesy 70's disaster flix! Thanx for posting! Don't wanna close my eyes! Don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing!
Mind Over Murder 	yay Professor Genki Tori should be able to see the future....4 kids with a total jerk and intense self absorption I just saw a full movie with the same name. I thought it was the full movie as this trailer. It was very good but Tori snd Desn weren't in it. I saw the last half hour of this movie back in the 90's. I wasn't a fan of Dean or Tori back then. When I heard that they fell in love making this movie, I wished I had seen the whole movie. Then I could have watched their body language etc. Search for: Mind over Murder CBS Movie Promo 1979 The trailer for that version is on you tube. I've still got a copy of the original from 1979 on VHS.That was pretty good actually. Yea this movie was filmed in my City one of the few and i still haven't seen it. This Movie was filmed in my City Ottawa. this is the film in which she met her husband, they were both married to others at that time.
The Miracle Worker 	LAURA FROM LITTLE HOUSSE ON THE PRAIRIE one of my fav movies! :) this movie was preceded by this nfl game?Broncos-Chiefs, 4, NBC, Charlie Jones, Len Dawson Melissa Gilbert was chosen by Patty Duke to play the role of Helen Keller. Patty Duke was sixteen when she played Helen Keller in 1962. Melissa Gilbert was 14. Why did Helen Keller's dog kill itself?A: You would too if you were named Auuurraaagggghhh! I am only going to see this because of Laura Ingalls! @Lifeofsundancekid A dead wringer for Amanda Knox. hi Melissa  as helen keier you are gart  @tylorsky123 Noooooo, it's a '70s version. And like most movies from the '70s... it sucks. I like the '60s version better. Wtf is this a parody? isn't the one playing helen keller a little too old????????????? @JinxTheGod Amen! And your talking about Sarah Palin on a HELEN KELLER video why? @etbella3: Doesn't Palin know how to use her money wisely? If not, then what the frack is she doing even being in politics, let along running a state as governor. Also, what the Kennedys did to Rosemary was WRONG, period-they could have made sure that she was given help, with their money (and what happened to her made them no better than the House of Windsor in their treatment of the three intellectually disabled members of their family .) it's LAURA!!!!!! xDbut yeah, she is too old, helen started to learn when she was 7 years old, melissa seems to be about 12 or 13 :p I like the 1962 Version. Melissa Gilbert looks too old to be playing a 6 year old Helen Keller OH MY GOD IT'S LAURA INGALLS!!!!  omg the lady that plays annie sullivan (patty duke) played Helen in the 1962 black and white version!
Moonraker 	I love jaws!! I have no issue with Space Bond, but with stupid villain's plan. If he wants to launch chemical exterminatus, that's his bussiness, but he won't repopulate Earth with nordic aryans by a fifty folks :D Thousands of people locked in some vaults, why not, but tiny space ark idea was incredibly stupid. If space, why not a giant nazi moonbase? xD it is for  me the best  movie of James Bond 007 This movie represents all that is wrong with the Roger Moore Bond series. roger moore played j.bond better than anyone else From the most exotic locations on earth, "Moonraker", will transport you to another world! Holly was a warm girl, with the right connections. More excitement! More thrills! More spills! And guess who's droped in for a bite? Jaws is back! From Earth, to the most spectacular adventure in Space! "Moonraker"! It's out of this world! a lot of people are slagging this movie off because it was in space You Only Live Twice at the beginning was set in space so. there's nothing wrong with this film its  brilliant All bond movies under Broccoli have childish and ridiculous elements! Grow up people! You think tapping someone on the shoulder from behind knocks them out? What rock are you living under? Can't go to one Moonraker vid without someone whining! Watch the abortion of a movie, Spectre if you want more realism like eye gauging, etc. No thanks! This is the greatest! I'm here to watch the vid, not comments from stupid 'fans'. Grow up, punks! U think Bond is realistic? Hahaha! Nope! Sorry! I am a Indian but I am the fan of James Bond 007 Worst ever Roger Moore Bond film! This may have been a downgrade from THE SPY LOVED ME but Drax was a step up. He was the aristocrat's aristocrat who was more concerned about Bond's death being amusing rather than practical. Bond In SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like when Jaws falls in love with the woman,  so cute.  It shows that even the evil have a heart. I blame this on Star Wars... My favorite Bond movie (together with GoldenEye).  Plus the most sexy (and not useless) Bond girl.Also an enemy who doesn't make you feel "how the fuck did he manage to lead them?". Well, at least it has the same title as the book.  Not much else, though. The physics in this movie is totally hilarious. They spin the space station to get artificial gravity, but then they walk around at 90 degrees inclination to the "gravity"!Yet, they had a NASA guy as technical advisor... The trailer is just as bad as the movie!
More American 	Graffiti Boy was Richard Dreyfuss smart for not signing on for this one. Similar to Keanu Reeves turning down Speed 2, both those guys were smart enough to know these would have been the one sequel to kill their careers. MAG is one of the worst sequels of all time, while the original is a director's (George Lucas) masterpiece. Lucas executive produced this one and later regretted it, saying "it made all of ten cents." Boy was Richard Dreyfuss smart for not signing on for this one.

How so? lacks the charm of the original. and the split screen scenes are goofy. You are a fucking idiot. It is just called American Graffiti. If you really think its all about graffiti than you are a 6 year old idiot. Is More American Graffiti good as the original? Because, some of my friends who love the original said that the second was cheap and bland. I really do love the original but, somehow deep inside I'm a little bit interested in seeing the second...Should I? that sucks that the greaser era died out after 1964 where is the graffiti in this shiti video So, Bob Falfa became a cop? @RogerColglazier Thumbs up x1000000000000000000000000 to you, sir. I'm only 13, i thinkand the first one was the greatest movie of all time. I don't like any modern media. The first one was always teh best one @catherinefan32 I AM WITH YOU. I LOVE THE GREASER ERA TOO. LET FORM A MOVEMENT TO BRING IT BACK. I WAS BORN IN 1966. I ALWAYS BEEN FACINATED BY THAT ERA I love More American Graffiti,a movie very underrated. @catherinefan32 Yea friggin hippies with thier counterculture
Mrs. R's Daughter 	I thought this movie was called February?? She's looking more like Don Draper's daughter everyday. looks interesting, but i cant stand emma roberts.... This movie came out in 2015 with the exact same cast this isn't new As soon as I saw that Emma Roberts in this movie I HAD TO CLICK ON IT! [ I don't drink ]] If it's a horror film and and they call if "erotically charged" then you know it's gonna be crappy . It's already on DVD, and it's called February, in my Country... Emma Roberts and that girl from Flowers In the Attic xD A Catholic school with evil extra curricular subjects. Just saying. Emma Roberts wasn't even in the trailer? why does a christian( with the cross and stuff) related movies are always scary o.o A24? I'm in Rubbish .... I got nothing from this trailer. First, I'm like "Okay, creepy music." I'm assuming it's going to be a scary movie, and then people start talking making no sense. And then... the end... I'm so confused. Have no idea what this is about and for Emma Roberts to start as the protagonist, I saw her once. This is what happens when you leave Sally Draper in boarding school. Smh. I loved this movie lol this movie came out in 2015.... Is this based on a book or is it an original piece?
The Muppet Movie 	Awesome video!I have to say, the classic "Muppet Movie" is as good as the 2011 "Muppet Movie" was!:) I didn't know Richard Pryor was in "The Muppet Movie" great HOLLYWOOD!!! I remember this from my VHS of ''The Great Muppet Caper''! I don't know what's up with the likes on this video, but they always seems to stay on 39 no matter how many times i keep re-liking this video. What music is this from 0:00-0:09 Yes, I remember this. For the longest time, The Muppet Christmas Carol was the only Muppet movie we owned, so this trailer's burned into my mind. I seen this trailer on my vhs release Muppet Classic Theater. Seen on Muppet Babies: Be My Valentine and Muppet Classic Theater. This was seen on "It's The Muppets!:Meet The Muppets! " and "It's The Muppets! :More Muppets, Please! "
Murder 	by Decree Some fans of Holmes enjoy this one. I've yet to see this but the word is   is that this take on Sherlock Holmes is a pretty good one. Another one the greedy scum won't put in the public domain. FYI: Murder By Decree was filmed in Old Quebec City with its cobblestone streets and dark streets (the part of the city inside the fort) which stood in for London England.  James Mason is the best Dr. Watson of all time. really? amazing I'm a sherlock holmes fanatic myself, I watched this one already going to watch the 1965 one now ^ ^ There's actually two, the other is A Study in Terror, done in 1965, and I believe both have the same actor playing Lestrade, although in this one he's 14 years older! :P I haven't seen either myself, but being a Sherlock Holmes fanatic, I want to!! and I surely will ^ ^ Knowing is half the battle ... now you need to actually WATCH it! never knew there's a sherlock holmes / jack the ripper film, now I know how amazing is that ^ ^ Man,theres a lot of spam in the comments. OTTIMO FILM...GRANDI ATTORI....STORIA CHE SFOCIA SUL SOCIALE.....MOLTO BELLO!!! haha man u lost the war and now u even have a black president! liberals 1:0 rednecks .... oh wait, this video has nothing to do with politics at all ... Jaws music... hahaha Check out Through the eyes of Robert Lees - the concept album by Lee Small (based on this film!) Yeah. But it fits into the Liberal mindset of bringing down " 'false' idols in high places"... like making Jesus into a hippy or an adulterer... Nothing is sacred with these types! Except Abraham Lincoln and Him crucified! Him who brought forth upon the continent The Left as a permanent warring fixture with the rest of the nation!  He's their only 'God',and only so far as he makes their party politics possible! No. In THE LAST SHERLOCK HOLMES STORY by Michael Dibdin, Sherlock Holmes was Jack the Ripper. Imagine Stephen King writing a Sherlock Holmes story... you'd have Dibdin's version. This movie was made to DISCREDIT the book, I believe, and I glad that it was! This has to be my favourite sherlock Holmes film. The scene in the asylum always gets me as we see holmes feeling emotion . A fantastic film and Plummer and Mason are well matched. Its a pity they did not do more holmes films together I believe this movie was actually made to discredit Michael Dibdin's THE LAST SHERLOCK HOLMES STORY from 1979. In that story, Sherlock Holmes WAS Jack the Ripper...
Murder by Natural Causes 	Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Excellent movie, indeed. Thanks for uploading. lady's a babe What's with Barry's helmet hair? Ha HA!! AWESOME VERY INTERESTING MOVIE THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE SHARED UPLOAD!!! nice movie.  good ending.  ( I think I know which one he chooses...) thank you thank you, love these old movies I am 74 Amazing - thankyou so so much - Columbo is almost my favourite - but having seen this, I would go as far to say this was better!!!Superb!!! Hal Holbrooks a great guy and a brilliant actor. Good film. Holbrook is a really good actor Wow! Excellent! Tye actors I loved from this era and a great screenplay... perfect! HAL STILL A GREAT ACTOR Really enjoyed this..wanted it to go on for longer...Hal Holbrook is wonderful x This really is an excellent film. I started watching because I've always liked Catherine Ross. At first, the film was a bit slow, but it got better and better the longer I watched. Top stuff. Hal Holbrook did an amazing job. Sometimes I think american cinema is going down instead of up. They really knew how to make a tv movie back then. 8:20 - that John Travolta? ending wasn't good at all!!
My Brilliant Career 	Great film, Judy Davis was astonishingly beautiful, a superb performance. Love this movie. Amazing! Gosh I love this film. I watched it three times already. Maybe a fourth next weekend when I fix my laptop. There are some memoreable quotes here" Loneliness is a terrible price to pay for one's independence. I think I might like this movie.  Great Film! Love this movie very much it's what made me a Judy Davis fan. Good god that mother of her's in this movie was a real piece of work it's like she couldn't wait to get rid of her daughter by marrying her off. @johnyzero2000 You have probably worked this out already but it is: Scenes From Childhood by Robert Schumann. Very nice piece of music. Thanks have this movie recorded on DVD. Sybella's such as exasperating character but i like her anyway and Sam Neill looks so hot in this. WHat is the name of this song playing over the trailer please? Haven't seen it since it came out.  And I would say that was around 1980. Strange that the note above tells us what a "worldwide sensation" it was at the time (and it was) ... but never says WHEN that was. My guess is 1980, anyhow. But what made me think of it was the music. Schumann's "Of Foreign Lands and People". On my brain a lot lately, who knows why, and then suddenly I thought - hey, it was the theme in "My Brilliant Career".  And - sure enough... ahhhhhhhhh <3 this is one of my most fav movies <3 i feel soooo bad for him !! I WANT HIM !! HAHAHA !! soooo romantic :) OMG, Judy Davis and Sam Neill, what an amazing cast. Really want to see this movie I loved this film for absolute years. My mum was Australian born so we saw a lot of Australian films--and this was a favorite. Took me years to find the music,too. Wonderful. @mfan0825 yes its on dvd as well. So it's on DVD, too, right? we just released the Blu-Ray for this one... I love this film so much, seen it 10 times and still cry. So romantic with a headstrong female lead.
My Old Man 	Never saw a X-Man movie before this one... OMG this was so AMAZING, it was my birthday present of my friends haha I still get chills watching this trailer.. R.I.P. logan huge jakeman thanks for everything  but pls come back for the xmen movies Satan bruises in the heal. the music at the beginning awesome best marvel movie Bruhh this trailer still gives me chills lol Great movie You know something???? by watching this trailer I've realized something!Hugh Jackman should play as Joel from LAST OF US game! ANDEllen Page as Ellie ........PERFECT MOVIE! so are we done with Wolverine alone movie? Everything about the film was so vulnerable. Firstly, Logan succumbing to the poison of the adamantium and the pain he endured throughout his life. Secondly, Charles succumbing to mental degradation and old age. Thirdly, Laura succumbing to the need for violence. Every- goddamn -thing was vulnerable. In superhero films, we see heroes and villains endure so much, but it never amounted to the things these characters have to endure in this film. The best Marvel movie!!! I this movie is sad but really good I want to watch it again Jean, just please, wake up for 3rd time and bring them all back to life :X Stealing Rick and Morty music?? Coming to Blu Ray May 23rd!! 3 thousand people won't let Logan go Best trailer ever! This trailer still gives me chills. Despite having seen the movie. What a feels trip.
Mysterious Island of Beautiful Women 	It was an exciting movie. Unfortunately the title does not convey the fact that the movie would be like that. The title makes it sound as if the women's beauty were the main feature of the movie.
Natural Enemies 	I love Hal Holbrook. He is an excellent talented actor. I want him to live forever!!
Night Creature 	Iam sorry to lost in my life one and half an hour for this bullshit movie Aaron Johnson won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for this just so you know can someone pls explain this movie to me? All i see, is Lois Lane and general zodd. Came to find opinions on the film, left with every comment about how much everyone wants to blow Jake and or bury their face in Amy.. Booooooooooooooooooo THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! you will love the intro. I love u Jake Gyllenhaal wow... Crazy guy writes an obsessive novel about his ex-wife. There, saved you some trouble. What's the music in this trailer called? absolutely amazing movie. couldn't get out of its vibe for some days afterwards. Jake Gyllenhaal in here and Donnie Darko absolutely amaze me. it was a great movie! :D Is it any good? that's the way life is Such a good movie. I loved the ending.. This was a awful movie It's a B movie with an A list actors, and somehow it worked! Im a simple man, when I see Nicole kidman, I hit thumbs down and move onto the next video. I'll watch anything with Amy Adams in it...!
Nightwing 	this a deathstroke film??..was shown more than the hero. looks like he weighs a buck and some change. NIGHTWING Needs his own  animated film! Please do a second season, that would be so awesome! You have already teased a second season with the end of Episode 5 (Red Hood)! Danny Shepherd is my ultimate Eyecandy! i'm goosebump now man!! yoooo this gave me chills wtf lmao why am I just now seeing this -.- This deathstroke mask is better than arrows yo that nightwing seems so legit we need a season 2! Please! As always, perfect. Flawless. ich hatte hoffnung und dann ist es ein fan film ich bin depressiv ihr biatches Dc comics is the best nightwing is so cute It would have been cool if his nightsticks would connect and make a staff like in the game WHEN I SAW JASON I GOT SO PUMPED I LOVE JASON (also holy cow, Dick's voice is absolutely perfect, like I don't care what he looks like, anything will do, but the voice just sounded so Robin-Nightwing to me makes me so excited like its a real tv series Props to the guys who made this. omg whos the guy who plays nightwing? i would never chase after a man. but for a robin, a bitch might walk!!
Nocturna 	Like sii ves esto en 2017! Such a sweet movie with a great message. I highly recommend it que pelicula tan buena. Hermosa Pelicula! :3 Guau Esto es un trailer o un resumen? Da igual, la peli es genial.
Norma Rae 	Time for Change at FRY great movie   sounds like another door slammin incident to me! I saw this in my Economics/Government class when I was a senior in High School when we were learning about Union businesses and such. Great movie.... still relevant,,, I saw that movie yesterday....great movie, great actiong and Sally.was soo nice back in the day.Hail from Italy\m/ And there are so many women selling off what she bought them with her pain and suffering!  As a Hyphenated-OVARIAN-American, I'm going to be voting extra HARD for those trying to sell off everything my "RAINBOW" of sisters and ancestors built.  How long are we going to let them cut us to the roots in every generation while they pass down their wealth.  sigh....I'm just THAT tired of all this fiscal inbreeding. THAT was her 30s?  Well DONE!  I always loved her, but missed this movie until today.  And boy howdy is it timely!  This movie is ......WOW! Ironic that this movie got Sally Field the Oscar, yet today, would most likely have laughed her off of the stage!  Our politicians and corporations could learn A LOT from a movie like this because in their eyes, unless it happens to them in their personal lives, it is really not happening, and it is not their problem.  It is not entirely their fault because we as Americans allowed the changes to happen, and we as Americans allowed ourselves to get stupid and slack off when it comes to education! With no manufacturing these days, how do we pull this off today? Shut down the deep fryer at fast foods joints? Stop cooking pink slim? Stop adding up our groceries? Stop pumping our own gas and checking out our own groceries give people their jobs back! Before we have to buy only what they make avalable These days I call this movie mt favorite. Where have all the Norma Rae's gone? People! It's ok to talk politics and religion anywhere anytime. Do not fear that anymore . It's how their winning! Sally Field's finest role...so glad she won the oscar for this....thanks for posting she's 64 years old now and still gorgeous as if she's in her 30's @moofushu   The champ is a great film.  but if you really want to cry, watch  "Th other side of the mountian."   When I was a kid, this movie and "The Champ (1979)" were probably the two best movies ever. The Champ left grown men crying at the movies. As a kid I had never seen that or since.  LOL, I was just watching Will and Grace... Karen had me looking for it too!! Might have to watch this movie. Karen Walker got me curious for Norma Rae
The Odd Angry Shot 	Great film, Graham Kennedy is especially good. genius film. take my money. The Vietnam war is portrayed as90% banter of the highest grade5% fighting scorpions and spiders3% Tinies 2% fighting the Viet Cong.I recommend Very nice looking print. Can't wait to get hold of a blu-ray of this when it's available. where can i purchase a restored version of this film.
Old Boyfriends 	fukkin lady bunny showin up at the end hey henny SHE IS NOSE BLIND plot twist, she killed him Lmao this looks awful heather graham is only I need I already love this movie... NYC for the win the  definition of a white movie Isn't that the guy who played Kristoff in OUAT I watch this trailer again and again when I am havinga bad day I lost my shit when I saw Lady Bunny... What is this shit!? LADY BUNNY IM GAGGED For the ones who saw the movie, what did you think ? I need to see this now! It looks funny! Cappie <3
The Onion Field 	Holy shit, is that Ted Danson?! This movie was required watching when I went through the Police Academy in 1982. NEVER relinquish your weapon, NEVER. Powell died in prison I think from prostate cancer in 2013 or 2014. Dirty SOB. One of the best films and books, great acting. Hettinger was treated appallingly by the LAPD. The ironclad assumption was he MUST have done something wrong at the traffic stop. Cut & dried. Training vids were shown using the traffic stop as something NOT to do. Poor Karl had to give lectures to other cops, and the theme, the point, the assumption was always- "how did you screw up and what should you have done?" As if it were that simple. Then the poor bastard had to live thru trials, re-trials, appeals, etc. At one point the longest trial in US history. Add to that the guilt that most survivors feel, and it's no wonder he had psychological problems. Why be a cop? Those two piss-weak punks outlived him. Powell & Smith had a falling out in prison, as low-lifes tend to. Smith beats the shit out of Powell. Then a friend tells Smith Powell is already going to the gas chamber for the first shot. But if he takes responsibility for the 4 subsequent ones, Smith might not join him, may just get life. So Smith gets on his knees in the shower and blows Powell. First full-on male-on-male sex scene I'd seen in a film. Pretty graphic & disturbing, and it shows nothing much matters to these scum. Not pride, not principles, not even your own sense of self. that acting. . . Is the original film on youtube? WOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOO Great movie ! I'm watching this video 5 years to the day this was posted! Even on Halloween, this video is quite gruesome and terrifying... As any piper knows."There is no more death." Gregory's dad was my music teacher in elementary and jr high school. Never knew Gregory and am glad of that. YES. John Savage and James Woods together since Salvador!!??? HELL YEAH I Have A Copy Of The Movie. Bought It On Line. Scream Jimmy scream. It's not on netflix! Amazon sales for $48 or Region 2 $21 @kenpalmer1965 as a psychopath i don't think powell has any remorse over killing campbell. Only way you can get any remorse from that asshole is by getting the punisher to gut him alive. But unfortunately we won't have that chance anymore would we WOW, Mario...that is something to really be proud of...most people would never want to admit being even REMOTELY related to a double cop killer. You need to re-think who you look up to. greogry powell is my blood related cousin have a picture with him and his parent's.
Opening Night 	THIS LOOKS GULAR=ASDIL ytf the end How great to see JC Cjazes back into the spotlight :) yawwwwnnnnn TF is this for the gay community? I'm tired of graces acting the same since that 70s show that's why he don't recive work as much as every one though he would Birdman shits all over this fucken milf WATCHING THIS
Orphan Train 	what song did you use and images? Beautiful, I can't wait to read it... The Orphan Movie is really fucking annoying makes me want to kill people please dont waste your fucking time If you liked this movie you'll love Don't Breathe Just kick that bitch in the stomach and ur good video uploaded in 2009 in the end cooming soon xD so when it comes? Haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm not sure I can handle this cute little girl being the villain. I just watched this 2 days ago, and it's 2017! I loved it and I'm 13 I was like so young while watching the movie I remember the nun woppie Goldberg. .. Spoiler alert: She's actually a grown woman . Can someone suggest some movies similar to this? beautiful Wait is Leo in this?? whaaaaat but cool movie Iam from india,Tamil nadu. iam a big fan of american horror-thriller movies. now this too one of my fav movie.isabella acting is pretty good.twisting is freaking out!!!!I give 10/10... They basically gave out the whole movie in this fucking trailer, thank fuck I already watched it, if I haven't, probably would've been a much shittier movie. Dont forget the fact shes actually am adult with the body of a child I love this movie. 'That's The Story of Thats The Glory of Love..' Why I fear of childreen in dresses?
Over the Edge 	unreal Charlie Haas on Pre-Gremlins 2 years. They were too young to care - i'm too old to care this movie had such an effect on Kurt Cobain , nirvana Someone have the full movie? The Clarences love & support "Over The Edge"! This film could have easily been about me in 1979...thank god it wasn't , ha ha :) soundtrack is awesome....
The Passage 	i like  diz move this film sucked. I stuck with it to only confirm that it really sucked. I think Pratt also knows it sucked. Lawrence got 20 million, Pratt, 12 million. wt? The ending would have been better if when all the crew woke they found two or more elderly people in the forest area and asked "Who are you, you are not on our passenger list?" and they replied "I know we aren't, but you will find our parents are" (LM) who hasn't see this film yet   https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6pjak-TKeOwT2V4YmoxUU94dEU Nice movie, I think in the ending part its Jim re-awakens by his sons and Aurora is hybernating until they reach by last 2 years. Jim and Aurora hybernated after their sons learned from  Jim and alternates. Excellent movie! Jessica Lawrence is BEAUTIFUL and I don't even like skinny chicks like that. She has flaws but I would overlook them because she seems to be such a sweetheart. She's a HOTTIE. GOD BLESS her & hers! Her physical appearance in the nude is an eye pleasing shock online also. Very pretty. I wouldn't mind having to look at her every day for the rest of my life either. Cudo's to whomever her partner is.Good Catch! SUPREME PLOT. That was the most boring movie I have ever seen. i love it Im back to say its legit :D Beatifful movie Don't watch this trailer! Just watched the movie and gooooood thing I refused to watch this spoiler trailer. Why do I get the feeling I just saw 90% of the movie in the trailer. he kinda raped her. . . starlord and mystique I really loved this film, as a huge fan of science fiction and space themed films and also as a romantic person, this film moved me a lot and brought me to tears in the second half of the movie when Aurora and Jim fell in love again :') simply amazing in my opinion 10/10 GREAT MOVIE -I HAD A LONG TIME TO SEE A SPACE MOVIE WORTH SEEING!! awesome movie this movie is just  awesome to watch
Paul Robeson 	What a great voice. What a great man as well. wow - that was very cool - paul r kudos Great man Jim Bloody Scots, they ruined Scotland! My dad was a miner nearly all his life and always spoke respectfully of Mr Robson,now l know why. Thank you Mr Robson for giving hard working men some dignity. wow, a man of his status appearing at the Woolmet. ! about 2 miles from me, and the place I learned my colliery training! Paul Robeson was such an incredible man. May his memory live forever UNION!   The look on the faces of the workers as they listen is heart warming. Un hombre extraordinario!!!!!!!! A tribute to Labour everywhere. Wonderful. A lesson for today's 'stars' Remember when Unions were honest, and for the workers? Bad ass man The wee bairn top right hand corner behind Paul Robeson, he must have had something to tell his mates and to remember all his days. "   I never died said he"  Keep that in mind!!!!  These are perilolus times!!! How wonderful! Thank you for sharing. thank you for sharing; never seen this footage before. Union! Excellent! Anyone interested in the song should look for "I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night", not Hall. Joan Baez and Pete Seeger recorded it among many others.
Penitentiary 	Which one had the midget shooting dice lol 1 or 2 Is it a Martial Arts movie ? No disrespect towards Ernie Hudson but Lionel Douglas from Who's The Man was the best Half Dead I remember sneaking into the UA Capri Theater on Fordham Road, Bronx NY to see this when it first premiered back in 79...GOOD Memories...GREAT MOVIE!! where's 1 at the full movie half dead don't box I kill! whatever happened to half dead (the "actor" who played him)damn.. he died of a heart attack at 56 Two sweet this movie is foe g s this shit go so hard   Good movie. Check it out.  This was my first film role I'm proud of it RIP Jamaa you made Art and put Actors to work .Thank you sir Classic This is like the old version of "Undisputed." Penitentiary pity the full movie isnt on you tube love to see this again hella good Best prison movie ever! Pinky's momma didn't raise no fool now When i was a kid i used 2 hear grown folk talking bout this movie. They had me SCARED STRAIGHT!      lol  It was the best sleep Too Sweet ever put on Half Dead... Now as far as I was concerned Half Dead was going to bust something and instead he got busted all upside his head!!!! LOL Saw  it when came out in the movie theater.Very long time .
A Perfect Couple 	Yo tengo la banda sonora en cinta de cassette Alguien me puede decir donde conseguir la banda sonora de esta pelicula? He mirado en tiendas y paginas pero no la encuentro.Gracias Hello everyone well i really like this movie and the songs  i remember i saw it in 1979 with a friend and guess what there is a sountrack and i have it bought it long time ago. Thanks.  She looks like Lady Gaga. Caught this one at an Altman film festival a number of years ago. I wasn't familiar with it, but I found it charming. I liked the songs. I see a lot of people complaining about this movie and the songs, but I liked it. Like a lot of Altman, it is not for all tastes and the music is of its time, but I liked this more than a lot that I've seen. Underrated. This brings back some great memories!!!  Here's a little inside movie stuff for you. I used to know the woman who played Alex's second date..the sex crazed woman. She told me she was never told what her charector was supposed to be like until the day she came in for shooting. She had no idea the charector was such a perv.  They never put out a soundtrack album for this movie which was a big shame. All the songs are great. I loved 'the lonely millionaire' and 'doesn't anybody care'. I don't know if those are the official names of them but you know which ones i mean. Tomi Lee Bradley's voice is remarkable. I wish the soundtrack was available. Something's got a hold on Me is a great pop song. watched it last night, fell asleep twice! wnna see it so bad
Phantasm 	I was 13 when this movie was playing in the theaters near you. The beginning of this movie raised my testosterone level to the highest (and I aimed very high XD). Just found out there's a number 5 which I know I must watch. This is kind of the the perfect movie to watch around Halloween. The music, the atmosphere, the blend of sci fi, fantasy and horror, the camaraderie between the main characters. Its perfect for a late night in October with friends. If this one dosen't scare you...You're already dead! Spent like a hundred dollars trying to track down cheap copies of these movies before Ravager finally got released. N F W. This movie truly scared the shit out of me when I was 16 years old in 1979. I was scared to walk home in daylight that afternoon!! Damn, this movie is good! The whole movie uses clever symbolism and original story telling. BOOOOOOYYYYYY!!! phantasm is the star wars of Horror movies Movie sucks. I'm huge fan of classic horror movies and forgive my lack of eloquence, but this movie sucks. What mystery are people talking about? The Tall Man is an alien that squishes dead people to re-animate them as slaves on another planet...that's the entire plot in 18 words. Some of the shots/effects are memorable like the ball but why this is so beloved is beyond me. I can handle bad writing and shoddy acting if the characters are interesting at least...none of them were. Great!! what's with the frame rate issues on the Blu-ray for the feature A great new blu ray There are plenty of people playing the role of an evil monster. But none of them will ever be loved in real life. Angus Scrimm was different. Pure evil on screen, & a true gentleman when you'd meet him. RIP, Jedediah Morningside. a couple of things go unexplained in this movie. reggie is stabbed in the stomach and you are left believing he's fatally stabbed. yet he appears in the end scene uninjured and no reference to the stabbing. yet he tells michael that his brother jodie was killed in a car wreck, which we didn't get to see. and what was the point of showing miss myrtle, reggie's maid for that split second. yes!!!! yes!!! Not sure...how I feel about this...
Players 	But good fucking Indians, they can not bring one single movie they inspired,  this movie is Italian job.  i don't remember the last time i watch Indian movie. awesome good full movie dekhe na chahatahu kaha he bhai link moklo aari bhai full movies kedhar hee Bablu up nice video The Indian job...... We all know Bollywood Directors copy old movies that were very succesfull, now there are very few of them that change the story a little but god damn man... this movie... Every thing... from "The Italian Job" trust me, if you have ever seen Players, go watch the trailer for The italian job and you will know what I am talking about.How hard can it be for those fat cunty writers/directors to actually use their brain for once and not copy a movie... frana is this made in bollywood? can someone tell me the name of the song??? wacth Italian job...it's better than it watch italian job
The Plumber 	A must see. is this a horror movie or romantic movie _ i dont get it Peter Weir has always been great at telling bizarre and extraordinary stories! really gr8 not to good et language does this mean the worst movie i seen ever The plumber rules! Can you say, "stoooooopid"?
Portrait of a Stripper 	thanks for posting this rarely seen film.  Joanne Woodward is amazing.  I've always admired her work, I think she's one of the finest actresses of her generation. "You can forget about me. Men can forget anything. It's a fact!" That's so damn true. Thanks for sharing this! amazing Excellent. What a good film. Greatly underrated film IMHO....  Joanne Woodward shines, and Richard Beymer is really good also. Joanne Woodward great actress!   :)  She was married to Paul Newman for 50 yrs.! Good realistic film.
The Prisoner of Zenda 	They don't make movies like this any more. Que bonitas y buenas peliculas yo las vi siendo un chico,pero nunca las olvidare que tiempos tan hermosos,grandes artistas directores lo mejor del cine.
Promises in the Dark 	love it but i hope they get together in the end
Prophecy 	watch the HD is great mee too !!! it look amaziiing!! First and I liked this movie
Quadrophenia "..... 	and all that other rubbish you could stuff right up your ass!"PARKLIFE! are you a model or are you a doctor or are you a moderate or are you a libertarian Just saw this flick for the 1st time today. Had a hard time understanding these people but I got the gist of it. Amazing nearly 35 years later and an ocean separating us. Yet can still relate to the teen angst slash young adulthood the main character was going through.Shitty job.Backstabbing friend.Getting high way too much.Delusional parents projecting their crap on you.And your dream girl turning out to be a sorry twat!!!!Too much of my life is in this movie.Ohh P.S. Jimmy does die does he.??? Best film I've ever seen  ''Adey Cobb was here'' maybe Dave Clayton too!!! I saw this movie and thought it was great. Out of my brain on the 5:15 ... been a while though. @XMrChrom3xx Your hairs look like cow licked it. hehehe @XMrChrom3xx Says guy who use a lot of hair gel @XMrChrom3xx And mod haircuts. Combination of nerd and Hitler haircut. Bwahahhahaha @XMrChrom3xx Better then your gay music for fancy pussys Fuckin wankers. Rockers rule. Scooter bastards and their fag music and suits. NAME OF SONG IN  1:08 PLISS
Quintet 	That's what you call a crappy trailer. *"This film is so bad it makes Battlefield Earth a masterpiece by comparison."*nonsense For those who don't like the trailer because it shows NO footage from the film, I think it actually works in its favor. The music and sounds are creepy and the slow-motion rolling dice appear like something a director like Dario Argentina would do for his Giallo films. The actual film is quite boring and a difficult watch. I heard there was a porno version of this known as "Queen Tit", lol! :P In an interview on the DVD for his film "Images", Altman said he counted it, "Quintet" and "3 women" as some of his most deeply personal and favorite projects.He also remarked that movies of his that were most praised ( M*A*S*H* or Nashville), he wasn't particularly crazy about. I bought this on DVD and it is probably the most bizarre movie that I have ever seen.I will say this: You should disregard the opinion of anyone who has seen this movie only once. I watched it once and thought that it was a piece of shit - one of the worst movies I have seen. Then, some weeks later a combination of boredom, the fact that I paid a pretty penny for the DVD and reminding myself that after all it is a film made by the genius Robert Altman forced me to watch it again and I liked it much more. Now I have watched it about half a dozen times and I absolutely LOVE it. You should watch this movie.. Then have a week go by and watch it again. I'm not saying that you will definitely love it, but this is the proper way of learning how to feel about this particular movie. Quintet is a really weird movie.  It's kind of boring, but I also love it. I like Newman's acting & I like the cinematography.  You can almost feel the grey, cold, bleakness that surrounds the film. Honestly, I absolutely love this film, but the trailer...they could've showed a close-up of a cow's eyeball for two minutes and it would've been more interesting. How about those intense...close up shots of tumbling dice..?. Must have been what Altman saw instead of dollar signs... Wow. They didn't even show any clips from the movie in this trailer
Racquet 	This is without a doubt the sickest VR game out there!  Room scale does not need to be huge considering the game is played staged in the center of a dome and theres no need to travel too far outside of it.  What you need is enough space and height to swing your arms around.  Game is highly active and gets me sweating like crazy.. Its a highly addictive workout.  I have one of the top 10 scores on arcade mode..  LOVE LOVE LOVE this game!! i got chills watching this! Great Trailer! Well Done! wicked trailer... love it! What's this dude's room scale set at?!? Great game, don't get me wrong, but this trailer is a little cringe worthy. I would love to see a parody of this trailer done with an actual VIVE headset on. The guy would be lying in a tangled, broken heap by the end of the trailer, asphyxiating on the cables with some broken furniture lying around. The new sturdier headset and the TPCast wireless add-on can't come soon enough to really allow me to get intense with this game. i love this game. Thx for the New EA-Version :) <3
Ratataplan 	E' la parodia del colloquio di lavoro quando ti rigettano perche' sei "troppo qualificato". E' PROPRIO VERO QUESTO E' QUELLO CHE SUCCEDE IN ITALIA  ha ha "Finlayson System" si chiama la ditta,  un bel omaggio a James Finlayson re dello slapstick nei film con Stanlio e Olio ... grandissimo film!!!!! This is maybe the only name of a film as old as this one I never forgot and what a surprice, it is even represented in youtube, great, thanks a lot! one of my favourites, and maybe one of the greatest i,ve ever seen. thanks for the video. when i typed 'ratataplan' i didn,t hope for much...;)) but here it is! grazie... it's on emule... sono cresciuta con questo film........ wow! cool! if you make a DIVX or something please gimme a copy.thanks. i bought a video tape on ebay, but it is PAL, i need to transfer to NTSC - such a great movie! wow! finally someone has RATAPLAN clip. I have been searching for this movie for around 15 years since I saw it for the first and last time long ago. I need this movie, where can I get it?
Ravagers 	FIRST *Guardian of The Galaxy |Vol. 2 Film|| Available**Click to Watch* https://plus.google.com/u/0/+VeliciaHartanti/posts/Sxnzihu1x18 Who else is excited for Jimmy Urine? Oh hey, It's Jimmy Urine. *_GUARDIANS of the Galaxy Vol. 2 M0VIE_*   ((( plus.google.com/u/0/+NEOFLiXentertainment/posts/XE6tokMDVDA ))) JIMMY!!! FUCKING FINALLY A VIDEO WITH HIM IN IT FOR THIS MOVIE! *Guys unload the top site with free games**----**>>>>> **#csgobessplatno2017** <-**------------**Put like where it works* the movie wasnt all that, im more excited for homecoming and ragnarok 0:15 he already looks like an alien with out the make up I got the Guardian of galaxy trailer as ad. Taser Face!!!!!! Is that Outside Dave at 0:35? Let's just hope that the makers of the movie don't rely too heavily on special effects to make a "good" movie.  To be honest, I grow very tired of special effects.  Just my opinion. why do i care about trailers when i don't even watch movies? guess they show so much in trailers now days you don't even need to see the film haha That very well could be red skull because at the end of the first Captain America red skull was beamed into space when he held the tesseract. please tell me the screen was squished because if not, that dudes head looks like it has been pushed down like 2 VERY NEEDED inches, or either we're just looking at a fun house mirror DC also had ravagers...
The Rebels 	the one thing that will break my heart is if Rex finds out anakin is Darth Vader Ooh the chills! at least we know that Rex survives it How did I know that X-Wings would be to Rebels what the Superman costume was to Smallville? 1:02 Bistans U-wing from Rogue One!! geez leave for one season and they're all dead termina aca toda la istoria de star wars. rebels Herra is going to be the only survivor LEGIT SPOILERThe emperor orders the Jedi Temple on lothal to be destroyed but thrawn wants to explore and find artifacts so The emperor tells rukh to kill him. All of you guys are saying this show was bad from the start but I have liked it all along, I have no problem with the art style either. If you are wondering why Disney is focusing so much on prequel eras its because they want to make it better Hera, Rex and Chooper survive we will see about the rest. I bet Ezra turns to the dark side. #hotkallus was hera riding a modified u wing in 1:15? While I watched this trailer I could Imagine that Ahsoka is the Wolf. But it would be better if she were in person there. What ya think? U WING AT 1:03!!! I'm betting Ka  and Zeb die. Ezra leaves the Rebellion, Sabine goes with the Mandos, Chopper and Hera stay, and this is Hera still with the Rebellion telling the story of the Ghost crew well somebody's is going to die REBEL SCUM ! ALL HAIL THE GALACTIC EMPIRE !!! dope Karabast! I have to wait til fall with all this anticipation?
Retrato de Teresa 	realmente son buenos actores cubanos y muy buena pelicula adolfo llaurado y deisy granados
The Return of the King 	even its trailer better than hundreds of movie CGI was on point now some  Directors. Abuses it Oh man, they didn't have the giant climax of the brass playing at the end of the trailer. They cut the music short when the title appeared on screen. They really should have let the music play a little longer, it would have made the title even more powerful! Second favorite movie after Harry Potter. This trailer captured the somber feeling at this point in the narrative: The West is under siege and might possibly fall, Frodo's strength is failing and Sam is lost with what to do, Sauron stands on the brink of victory and you honestly questioned if the Forces of Good could stand up to the assault or would be swept aside Two towers is the best in the trilogy. I think the Thor Ragnarok trailer finally outdid this one... took long enough... I wish cinema would go back to set designs and utilising only when necessary the need for CGI.  As it currently is now, I feel no connection to most fantasy/superhero/sci fi movies because of the overuse of CGI.  Everything looks so... rounded and fake but pretty.  Like I'm watching a really good animated movie trying to be realistic.I'm glad the Lord of the Rings was made at the turn of the century and before 2007 when everything went CGI crazy.  Actors can't keep acting on green screens for EVERY SINGLE scene. The most Epic film I've ever seen What are the chances these movies will be remade in the future? Some movies should never be touched... This series is probably on top of that list BEST. MOVIE. EVER.When I saw this trailer so long ago, I felt uneasy because of what they were up against. As you see 0:45, and did they lure you with the trailer as so many movies/shows do) No. The movie delivered everything and more. what's the name of the background song? is that the one wich some ppl mistake the Lux Aeterna by Clint  song from requiem for a dream movie? Fucking hell this movie is almost 14 years old already. I can still remember the first time I saw it. Since I was a child I've watched all movies once a year. This isn't just a movie anymore, it's a work of art. hbayib klbi aishtaraku biqunati waduemuni layk waishtirak fuduh arwuhalakum hbayib klbi aishtaraku biqunati waduemuni layk waishtirak fuduh arwuhalakum BEST.FUCKING.TRILOGY.EVER Being born in 96, I did not get to experience this when it first came out. Luckily, the local cinema have a yearly LOTR marathon :-)
Rich Kids 	Det er en lorte film Switzerland > Scandinavia Slap lige af med den sviner der. FUCK SO LOW MOVIE Kravl nu bare tilbage til det hul du er kommet fra. Total wtf film :D Gentofte Rungsted? Wow og 60 % af dem er fra den by jeg bor i... tnx bro :) 0:23 - why is this song? name?
Richard Pryor 	worse person to ever play Richard smh fuckn clown Marlon is a good actor but he doesn't look like Richard at all and the fake goatee wtf. don't like it. Eddie Murphy still does the best pryor. its more about him off screens and Marlon did great He doesn't fit the role.. They could find better for sure. Yea marlin Wayne did a horrible job for sure .. you can tell marlin has never been high a day in his life .. which is okay don't get me wrong . But not okay to play Richard Pryor ! Smh bad acting for sure .. love marlin and his brother but he sure didn't do good on this one ... make sense why he didn't get the part he owns this part he put his heart in that He definitely should have gotten the part after that Marlon Wayne you killed that shyt & you did your research very well. My favorite album is Richard Pryor's That Nigger Crazy. I grew up sneaking around listening to that shyt and knew that there were some truth it than going to church on a Sunday. Richard was dealing with some things....  I think he did well. Mike Epps should've been on there mike Epps. colder wow I hope and Pray marlon. do get this part he doing a wonderful job doing Richard Pryor you got my vote marlon waynes awesome!!!! hell nah HELL NO! There's only one person who can pull off this role! ICE CUBE! horrible I think Marlon did a great job. I see a lot of criticism in the comments section. I would just like to say that being an actor is not easy. And what Marlon did was put himself out there and I think he did an amazing job. And to the people who say he cannot act: grow up and I dare any of you to put yourself out there as an artist. I think Marlon Wayans is best doing drama, he was spectacular in Requiem for a Dream and he even did a good job in the movie The Heat.
Rock 'n' Roll High School 	Found it on Blu-Ray! :D Gabba gabba HEY! I wish my school was like this. anyone who doesn't listen to the top charts is considered a weird or emo. I wish I was born at a different time so I could grow up when bands like the Ramones were popular. I'm 16 with no punk rock friends and stuck in the generation of Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and whatever fad boy band is popular now :// Still my #1 fav movie of all time! GABBAH GABBAH HEY!!!! I first saw the movie along with The Who's The Kids Are Alright, a double feature.  I didn't know The Ramones were a real band. I didn't find out they were for a few years.  Been a fan ever since! Saw them live 5 times and even got their autographs once. I grew up watching this movie rocking n roll high school. Only if high school was really that way at least it would be fun to be at school Seeing this makes me a little disappointed over my own school, this awesomeness will never happen.... Reminds me of my high school daze  Did u seriously just type "and some guys called The Ramones?" why are we sis and brother you wierd 1:53 fuck the poliiiiice!!!! Darn spell checkW.hatW.wouldR.iffR.RandallD.o? i remember watching this 13 years ago when i was 5 .. bout to look for this dvd have the rolling stones killed my dreams are dead now that i know joey is:c this is the best movie ever. i just finished watching it. my dreams got killed when my mom a so awesome. You know who you sound like, right? you dont say i want the ramones at my school :( but noooo
Rocky II 	You're going down man! You're going down!!! YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!!!!!!!! Best one of the series. Neat number 1 on y rocky list and number 1 in my all time favorite movie!! Great follow up movie! Duke was right. "The man fought WARS in the ring!". Rocky, the best movie series of all times After 37 yrs, i still get teary eyed watching this trailer. Best film serie EVER!!!!!! RIP Tony Burton. The rocky series is one of my favorites Wow this movie is amazing! It really inspires me to not give up and that I can do better. I'm not sure if it might be my career path but I wish to at least start practicing eating right and healthy and workout. It really does inspire me to become a boxer. I always preten to throw fast and hopefully hard on punches on the air. If only I still had my punching bag filled with sand, rocks, and clothes. "He recommended I don't fight, but I recommend I do." That's what I say lol It should have ended at Rocky 2. The only worthy sequel to the original. finest movie of all time A decent sequel. Basically a retread of the first film but done well. For me the best thing about the movie was Talia Shire...................brilliant performance. Rocky II easily had the best and most satisfying fight of all the films.
Roller Boogie 	linda mom was friends with linda I remember seeing this at the movies (3rd grade?) but I don't remember much of the plot ENCHANTING, TRULY Linda Blair makes this movie worth watching. This is coming to Blu ray next month i think this movies out of print I still have my rollerskates. But I've lost my boogie TCM network now has this movie on their line up. Just aired last week. Twice so far this year. It's become a cult classic. Rick James tapped that. F*cking Classic. I think they were hoping to start some kind of trend. Didn't work! I Loved that Mark Goddard "Major West " from the TV show Lost In Space appeared in this film as the villian...Way cool ultimate crazy movie from the 70's. I remember seeing this in the theaters. Great movie :) que recuerdosssssssssssssssssssssss This is super lol. Great companion film to Thank God It's Friday & Xanadu. Movies like these & Flashdance were fun, escapist films. I'm glad I grew up during the 70's & 80's.  "Coming your way for Christmas" OMG, they don't use the politically correct "holidays", I LOVE LOVE the 70s... Linda Blair was so pretty <3 hehe
The Rose 	I loved watching the Rose every night and they pulled the plug was like a punch in the stomach! It's a sorry thing to have something you enjoy after you go to sleep with it playing every night to have it yanked from you cause of a crappy excuse!!!!! your right.she got robbed. What is the piece of music at the beginning of the trailer/end of the film before her homecoming concert?? Still my favorite. I loved that movie the Rose felt bad for her no one was listening and love the song The Rose She got robbed at the oscars Roll one hell of a movie where a Berber good movie My friend & I took our girlfriends to see this movie when it first came out, they were inspired by Rose and broke up with us a couple of weeks later ! lol What's the name of the song??*Gets popcorn and waits for comments* I cannot STAND Janis Joplin (I don't like her voice, I don't like her looks, and I think that she was one drugged-out, burned-out Hippie), but Bette Midler is cool, and, although I've never seen this movie, ti looks interesting...although the end of the trailer is as depressing as HELL. Best movie of her acting career by far. Amazing. The performance of a lifetime and Bette has given so many! Don't even get me started on Beaches. I was an absolute MESS! Janis Joplin was so SUPREMELY talented! I wish she had truly known love. Bless her sweet soul. L Bette Midler's a better singer than Janis Joplin, period. I see me Reminds me of Amy Winehouse... Whew, what a way to end a trailer. you obviously lack the ability to think outside your own desecrated box of poor reality...What Bette did here was to empower the spirit of Janis,not redefine or re invent her....but to honor her...an so she did. I f you had a heart filled with true   discernment,you would understand the true gift that not only Janis left behind but the glory of Bette's effort to honor her..Sleep on it....pray on it ...and think again 61.. fuck you
The Runner Stumbles 	Been looking for this movie forever.  Dick Van Dyke gave an Academy Award performance.  Why wasn't he recognized?????Wonderful movie, wonderful cast, great direction. This needs to be on DVD! I wish I could find this movie. y'all this was intense This is one of the best movies of all time! I remember seeing this movie on HBO back in the 1980s. Thank you for putting this together, but could you please, please, I beg you, publish the whole piece! Where can I find the whole movie online? thanks for highlighting this film. didn't think anyone cared about it. Thank you so much!! I haven't seen this wonderful love story since it was first in theaters. I can u buy this movie? i saw years ago. I loooooved this movie when I was a girl. It's stayed with me for over 30 years. Thanks for the upload! I have looked for this movie myself since I was in my mid-teens.  It has stayed with me too all these years. Great performances!  Does anyone know where I can see this whole film?  I've been lookinf for it since I was 14!I can't find it anywhere online to buy. Thank you! some bitch named Mrs. shandig Who killed her? Please tell me The Runner Stumbles, The (1979) as Song ("My Rumble Seat Gal" was done by Earnest Gold i loved it, the movie is great, i have slp VHS recording i made as the taping ran over into the next movie I was overwhelmed how great the movie was. Dick Van Dyke was amazing as the priest in turmoil as he realized his love for the sister, Kathleen Quinlan who looks great in a burlap bag, portrayal of Sister Rita, well how can't any man not fall in love with her. i had a dvd made since no studio DVD available
Salem's Lot 	They're making a Jewish version of this called, "Shalom's Lot" Okay, so is this a movie or a TV series like "IT?" When I used to have crush on Bonnie Bedelia Cool to see but the aspect ratio sucks. Ghost's Opus Eponymous album brought me here! Best vampire film of all time. Great plot and characters based on a novel by Stephen King. This film along with Christopher Lee Dracula films and Anne Rice,s Vampire Chronicles plus Ingrid Pitt movies are the real deal when it comes to great vampire films and books. Stuff like Twilight. True Blood and The Vampire Diaries I don,t like, they don,t have the great plot and characteristics and feeling of the older vampire fiction. I move with the times but I,m oldSchool when it comes to vampires. Wasn't that house actually supposed to be haunted in real life? Very scary movie :-( Underrated flick, for sure. 2:27 that's a rap right? Flamethrowers I tells ya, solves all yer problems real good. Seriously though, all horror movies could be remedied with a flamethrower. Vampires? Burn em. Zombies? Burn em. Haunted house? Burn em. Possessed people? Burn em. Aliens infested your neighborhood? Burn em. I could go on. XD For those of you people who don't consider vampires scary as hell, I'm gonna prove this.You see a vampire like this one known as Barlow who has the Nosferatu-like appearance right here?This is what you call an ugly vampire, a monster vampire, a proper vampire and hideous monster vampires are way much scarier than the beautiful human ones. mierda de mierdas me hice spoiler They never tell you what happens to Matt Burke. In the book he dies but in this I don't think they tell you after he's in the hospital. this was a really scary movie back then in the 70's. quick impale a T-bone steak throught his heart. <3 It's horror luke i dont think sense is needed Bonnie Bedelia still had that young girl hawtness
Sanctuary of Fear 	Is there an age requirement for this attraction? Thanks for the blood, sweat, and tears, its been a pleasure being at your side working this Haunt with you! #loyaltyforever
Scum 	100% YES!!! BEAT THEM UP! So is this like a battle royale with PvE aspects? looks good! keep up the hard work devs! neat vid nice stuff
The Shape of Things to Come 	I enjoy cheesy old movies. That being said. This was CRAP! Huge story problems. The ship gets crippled and is unable to continue. So they land the ship for repairs. The guy that can fix the ship is dead so they just take off and everything is just fine. Then the ship runs into more trouble and  is unable to so much as fire a missile. Having only enough fuel left to limp into orbit  They some how land the damn thing on empty, fly it all over the planet and take off and outrun the planet as it explodes and fly light years back to earth Completely out of fuel and completely crippled. I love SF.I'm 45 years old.I saw this many years ago.It was crap. beyond the earth, beyond the moon, beyond the ripoff This movie has as much to do with the book as Alex Proyas' I, Robot has to do with the Asimov novel
She's Dressed to Kill 	OBRA-PRIMA!!!!! yet another transphobic film presenting trans women as psychotic killers. what a load of garbage.
Silent Victory 	She wasn't really deaf what a bunch of propaganda kittys record set in 1977 was 3.72 at 396 mph sammy miller ran a 3.58 at 386 mph in 1984 at santapod raceway and still holds the record for the 1/4 mile ET I've been waiting for decades to see this again.  Thank you!   Love Kitty O'Neil, true legend... Thank you so much for uploading this movie! Stockard Channing positively shines in this film!!!Thank You!!!
Skatetown, U.S.A. 	The late Dorothy Stratten (former Playboy Platemate) is in ttis movie. Kathrine Kelly Lang played a roll in this movie Brooke skating :) Patrick Swayze and Billy Barty in the same film? I am so buying this on Amazon. Oh, yeah....ROADHOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!! Why is it that I was 8 years old when I saw this at the drive-in and still remember it?Why? Why? Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!?? Ron Palillo! I will have to see this, even though he had that beard!!  Shite, when the video started I thought it was going to be a horror about a town full of kids who murdered people with their roller skates.....I'm so disappoint ;n; OK, they win with the line, 'Greatest Story Ever Rolled' How can I see this movie?? Can't find it anywhere!!! It's like a car wreck. It's hideous, but I can't look away .. This week's episode of the Indycast brought me here!!! What was the second one??? OOOH HONEY HONEY PATRICK SWAYZE WAS MAKIN' HIS MONEY! You betta roll it out and put it in the bank! You were really in this movie? I love you :DThese movies were awesome :) I want to jump into my display, why was i born '76.in the asshole of the world instead in LA?? nothing can beat Roller Boogie !!!! Holy shit.. I couldn't even watch the whole thing.  It just hurts my brain so bad. I saw this theatrically earlier this year, and I feel weirdly special about it even though it's pretty awful. I think Avatar is the film that finally took Skatetown USA out as the top grossing movie of all time, but I could be wrong.
Something Short of Paradise 	this is on iTunes now!!! If you have a copy of this album, your lucky, there's not to many out there, only Cassettes and vinyl. Never to be released on cd or iTunes. This album is truly a wild trip and experience. goin back to performing this song in my repetoire..after 30 plus years of absence.  Great guitar piece..close enough for Me!Thanks I think this is on of my favorite Curry songs. So much talent. grew up with this guy...what a great song Eargasm When are his 3 albums going to finally be released on CD?!?!?! That voice though, so fantastic. I can't just listen to this once..what a beautiful song!!!.Tim is the man!! What a powerfull voice!Love you Tim  What a powerfull voice!Love you Tim  Dick Wagner is an amazing song writer....... One of my favorites by him..He was great in the movie Times Square and Clue funny and intelligent... Yes, please! Holy crap!  I just found out that Dick Wagner also played guitar on the song "Sloe Gin," from Tim Curry's Read My Lips album!  Now I'm really, really, REALLY impressed -- That is the most heavenly, emotional song I've ever heard, and Wagner's guitar accompaniment  is exquisite. Actually, it was written by Dick Wagner who played guitar so spectacularly on the "Fearless" album.  Not surprisingly, Wagner also wrote S.O.S., which I think -along with SSoP- is the most beautiful song on the album.  Tim Curry and Wagner collaborated on writing some of the other songs on the album. He has such a cool range -- His voice is so powerful in some songs, and then there is this  tender voice ... Wonderful. His albums belong on cd! Someone like RAVEN RECORDS should do it: they coulkd bring us all three of his released lp's on one cd, and do a kick ass job of it.
Sooner or Later 	DENISE MILLER WAS THE WORST "CELEBRITY" PLAYER ON THE PYRAMID!!!! THE ABSOLUTE WORSE!!!!! Meanwhile, she's petrified, lol. I cried after the film, beautiful film and profound I love this movie! the Movie that will always live on in the hearts of all Rex Smith fans out there!! as you can see I am a Rex fan and this movie has become a "anthem" if you will of our love for this man and his talent :) and for some reason i'm logged in as matt....but it's me---his way cooler and younger wife......now if i could just convince him to wear tight pants and feather his hair...... better than it's EVER been before
The Space Movie 	omayghad!! august 19 was my 11th birthday, bur I didn't checked that movie that day!!! augghhhhh!!! but I've watched it last week so it's fine... i love u Asa Butterflied!!! So its all about fleshly desires ? Animals. Movie was great ....But ending WHYYYY I have watched this movie yesterday I felt like too emotional, I even Felt Like I was the one 16yrs old guy in the movie. Once you've tried Martian you can't go back to Earthling. Trump: "Deport the martian back to mars." Came here for a trailer, saw the whole damn movie instead. Thanks for ruining. why that movie is not famous????this movie is a masterpiece...i would place it next to interstellar... 0:10 dat bluescreen doe. is this worth to watch? By looking at the poster, i thought it's related to Ender's game, sequel or something, after watched the trailer, thought that no wonder he can fight alien so well. i thought the name was Ass Butterfield by taking a quick peek, my bad. 0:18 did they actually forget to draw the dark side of Mars, or is there a better explanation for us being able to see the stars behind the planet? Ok...right...nice 3 minutes movie. No need to watch full version. Asa is those cute Child Actors that grows up UGLY AS HELL! Having that huge age difference between Asa and Britt, the movie should be renamed to "The AGE Between Us" Great movie. A little short at 3 minutes and 9 seconds, but a quality watch nonetheless. LOL....more fake space programming. Wake up folks, space is fake, earth is flat! i love asa butterfield
Stalker 	This trailer sells Tarkovsky's classic as a bombastic horror flick. The world is agonizing of dumbness. YO is that the original Alien trailer music? The editor who put this together deserves some props. GOOOOD GOOOOD GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think I found an adjunct of the zone underneath a girder bridge in the scrublands around Cockfosters. Amor Eterno a Stalker Will hopefully include a re-cut so it's not as painfully slow. Love it! So exciting. It looks terrific. Finally a restoration!
Star Trek 	One of the best trailers ever My Goodness I still Get Chills Watching this Best trailer I've ever seen Must, warn.  Numb tongue.  So funny. i remember seeing this when i was five years old...FIVE. YEARS. OLD. AND I SHAT A LITTLE Best trailer ever I loved this trailer and the actual film What is the name of the music for this trailer. Freedomfighters by Two Steps From Hell is the Music <3 the trailer music is so fucking awful compared to the films soundtrack This movie is better than The Force Awakens by leaps and bounds.  Yeah I said it.  Come fight me. FREEDOM FIGHTERSSS!! this is my favourite of the 2009 reboot Abrams raped star trek and made it into a mindless repeat with lots of flares and Romulans with shitty tattoos.  The new captain kirk looks a stupid male version Lindsay Lohan. JJ Abrams Is Both Star Wars And Star Trek Chris Pine as James Kirk? Jar Jar Abrams as director? Are you f#king kidding? I've not watched this movie yet, but I'm a little worried about the trailer. What got me into Star Trek (the TV shows) was it's focus on philosophy, ethics, politics, and adventure. Please someone tell me the movie has all of these things, as isn't some generic sci-fi action movie like the trailer shows.
Starcrash And Lewis 	Coates tried his DARNDEST!!!!!!!!!!! First battle beyond the stars and this!!!? Why would they copy Star Wars can't they just make a decents Space film? George Lucas ripped this off! Nice going MST3K! No movie was ever titled that accurate.... here because mst3k This...this looks like the tragic union between Clash of the Titans, Flash Gordon, and an Atari 2600 I like quite a few cheesy flicks but even the trailer was brutal. While fast forwarding I counted at least four other movies it ripped off. wondering how these franchise did not become as big as star wars?? The sequal was better, Star Fender Bender. And the third one was even better, Star Careers Crash MST3K murdered this. What a beautiful piece of shit. When is this being released? Looks good. Omg the cheese of this movie! Can't wait to watch it! They should have just made it a porn.... thank you George Lucas I would like to take birth in this colourful laser age... George Lucas stole a lot from this movie for his Star Wars.  A lot of people don't know that.
Starting Over 	I only want to see this because one of my favorite actors is in it-Logan Lerman!!!!!!!!!!!(I love his role in the Musketeers movie!)
Strangers 	"Because you were home."That's why this movie is so f*cking scary! There is no reason, they did nothing wrong; these guys only kill because they want to and that can happen to EVERYBODY here. Even to YOU. And that's why this movie is so much more scarier than every other horrormovie It reminded me of 'Vacancy' and ' Hush' Overall Vacancy was the best of these three  IMO Isn't it creepy that this is based off of a true story? It looks a lot like "You're Next" from 2011. This movie was stupid asf Anybody here from Shane??? This shit fire yo aint that a bitch you get terrorized by complete strangers just because you was home. You didn't even do shit just because you chilling at home imma kill you. You know how pissed I would be if I died and in heaven found out these motherfuckers said I was practice it will be easier next time. Like I wasn't even the real deal just a nigga for them to test if they ready or not to do this on a daily. I blame the couple tho that's what you get for getting a house in the middle of nowhere no neighbors no roads just woods. lucky I live next to a Walmart help is a 3 minute jog away The movie that'll make anyone paranoid 1:07- JESUS CHRIST I thought this movie was really scary This movie sucked...there's a lot of scenes that never made any sense. Like I'll give you one for example, if you are in a home invasion crisis situation and you have no access to phones in the house, does it really make any sense to leave your wife in a unsecure household while you run out to the woods to get the radio to call for help? I would never let my wife leave my sights ever at anytime if I'm in that kind of situation. oooh yeah, this is what horror is all about, horrible story, undeveloped characters and full of jumpscares that doesnt make sense, if it didnt have jumpscares i am sure everyone would fall asleep watching this.dont watch it, it doesnt even make sense, they could had kill them during the entire movie, but they didnt...why? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy que mieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedooooo Liv Tyler always have that face like she's about to cry and shit...good movie thou I remember the first time i saw this when i was 9, shitted on my pants The movie that made the Purge happen. It was a scary movie but the husband was a friggin idiot, always going off on his own thinking he's invincible. And Liv Tyler's character was annoying as fuck. masked man is the best! :D For those wondering, this is by far one of the scariest and best horror movies I have ever scene. The creepiness of the killers makes the film eerie and their presence of them just watching and waiting is scary initself
The Streets of L.A. 	0:55 that's definitely snoopdogg is this what LA is like? I don't know how many years later, and I just noticed that throughout this whole trailer there were only two shots where Nick wasn't a Bad Cop. lol #1 Game cube 'game without a Doubt Good old True Crime! one of my first PS2 games. Most action-packed trailer ever. Xbox?? I used To play This game All Day in my Game Cube!! what's the song used in this trailer True Crime - Streets of LA  download pc If you're from LA, this game was the shit! Looks like an american Sleeping Dogs Should I get this or NBA street vol 2 Another great game that is a worthy addition to my Xbox collection because of 3 words: Custom Soundtrack support.In the game, I added my own customizable soundtrack with music by Ricky Nelson, Carl Perkins, Art Adams, Danny & The Juniors, Johnny Cash, Dean Carter, The Music Explosion, etc. miss this game true crimes in the streets of L.A memories with this game wish i can get it again Dr. Dre and Snoop's "Deep Cover" would've been a perfect track for this trailer lol I loved this game so much as a kid and then I lost it when I was like 10 lol. I just bought it again last year and it takes me back haha love this game Throwback to my Nintendo Gamecube days boiiiii!!!! This was the shii frfr I don't even care about graphics this looks like a fun game. miss thus game
Summer Camp 	the ending was very surprising tbh, I mean the children had to become infected aswell? hi guys this is nice movie and not bored Wuzent freaked out Loved REC! Absolutely one of my favorite horror movies & zombies of the past decade however I don't think a REC clone is the way to go & Summer Camp feels like it's a REC clone WOW IT LOOKS TERRIFIC!!! shit movie shit shit shit movie.. couldent watch till the end This is 1 of the worst horror movies i ever watch.. So unproffessional is a shit! I watched this and my face was filled with disappointment Was a decent movie! Just got done watching this, truely fuckn solid and original. You gotta watch the whole thing though! another zombie movie, no thanks. Looks like garbage Everytime I see and hear that screen flickering ka ka ka ka in any horror movie trailer, instant turn off.. after u eat chipotle 1:39 this looks like shit  these are totally not the producers of conjuring
Supersonic Man 	demasiado CUTRE Mein Lieblingsfilm yes i finally found it one of my childhood movies my mom just looked at me and told me i hate it when u come across these old things because u cried when u knew we lost it lmao Now this is how you make a trailer...like Pumaman, Ultraman and Road House combined This is not a trailer. It's a scene from the movie. What is this song? Can't find it anywhere! Pu-ma man, he flies like a moron.
Survival of Dana 	Those baby blues are timeless. Funny Marion Ross is playing Meliissa's grandma when she was playing her mother the same year Mrs. Cunningham Melissa Sue Anderson as Mary Kendall little house on the prairie I'm love it little house on the prairie 1979 that's is Luke Evans born April-15-1979 All those people walking into the school at 3:19 looked like adults. And Judge Reinhold in this movie threw me off. What is this movie about? I never see it before! I love Melissa Sue Anderson one of my favorite actress! Rare rare rare, thanks. I read about this in Shock Cinema years ago and have wanted to see it ever since. Love the weird 'Just What I Needed' homage at the beginning! Awesome! Actresses from my two favourite shows: Little House and Dr Quinn: Melissa Sue Anderson and Barbara Babcock:) What a joy to watch it
Swim Team 	I watched this film last night at Stephen F Austin University, through The Helping House in Nacgodoches , Texas. It was a great film, very encouraging and touching. I laughed, and had tears. I could relate to each of these families. I wish there could be more services for these kids as they go into adult hood instead of being finished when they turn 18. They need more instruction on how to live as independently has they can. Bravo to this film The Kids and families. This is Hannah's mother. She is on the spectrum, but knows more about accounts and the computer than me lol. I'm so very proud of my cousin, this family is amazing! Nice Trailer
El Super 	Where can I buy this? I cannot find it anywhere.
The Tenth Month 	Very impressive movie but are the Vietnamese in general shy to tell about the death of a beloved one? I saw another movie and it was the same not to tell about the death of someone. Thanks for sharing this movie. Watching this movie, plus "Nostalgia for the Countryside", "Season of Guavas", I have so much respect for Dang Nhat Minh. Beautiful stories told by an excellent director!
Terror Out of the Sky 	Wow ! that was a cool movie; love cs She should not worry about Nick He is off screwing some big Grizzly Bear somewhere. You Think.? They don't allow you to have bees in here...... Attracted to loud noise,.. Totally ignores coastguard chopper.. Stupid kid stupid parents should have left the dog in the car. Dan Haggerdy does not make a good Nick, In the 70s this was a scary thing especially for us kids For 2 minutes she is moaning... weird loved it thanks As ridiculous as this movie is, it's a work of genius compared to "The Swarm" omg- Grisly Adams and Efrem together!!!!!!!!!!!! Shot himself in the head ? That's one way to stop the buzzin' gaensehaut Is this a bee movie or is it a b-bee movie, or is it an a-bee movie that I saw on the BBC, see?! Fine, I'll say it. NO! NOT THE BEES!!!!! Killing me won't bring back your g--d---ed honey!!!! Yes, this movie and the previous one (The Savage Bees) are pretty dumb, but you have to remember flicks like these were what inspired M. Knight Shyamalan's *The Happening*.  This is how off the rails that eco-obsession got in the 1970s... and is getting again. The bees have filed a protest after this movie for being called a killer.
Tess 	music? The music, such a shame. Not a patch on the score for the 1979 movie I love your trailer, and most of all, the song, I have always liked it. Eddie Redmayne was a total miscast. But since that's not your fault obviously, great vid! Thanks! This film was brilliant, and your video does it justice. Requiem for a Dream ? Seriously ?Something's truly wrong with you !? amazing movie! It's one of my favorite! Loved it! Excellent tension building and well edited :~) Nicely done :-) @TessDurbeyfield81 no its written by Clint Mansell. "marion Barfs" is one of the songs from the movie...
Thirst 	one of the best vampire movies ever! I managed to snag the single copy of the Director's cut that Amazon had.Envy me. If Only they were all a little better looking This looks so fucked up! twilight but a lot better!!! not a bad trailer either! awesome crazy ass movie right here
Tim 	I don't think it's good enough I am findin the song that starts at 1:08 could somebody help me ? :( song 0.34 ???? Lobster Todd plays Jeff Buckley... O.O ???? Is this about Jeff's dad, or Jeff? Oh, and now I know JB was only 5'7" . Thanks for ruining my fantasy Trailer. My god. They picked an actor because his hair is similar. I feel like the trailer is way easier to follow and more concise than the movie Looks like typical "season" movie without a soul, that you forget on next day. This guy does a really good job of singing terribly like the real guy Greetings. that is the girl from 28 days? or it's just my imagination...(? Hey Lonely Boy, I'm watching you, xoxo Gossip Girl. please I would like to know the name of the song played at 1:32 Jeff's music and history deserves to be told in a movie where he is the main plot, he was too great to be related, even with his dad. that's weird cause i was just watching 6 years and thought ben rosenfield looks so much a like dan and then bam turns out they have a movie where they're supposed father and son No you're Lonely Boy Complete character assassination of Jeff Buckley ok so despite the title, the film is really more about jeff buckley than tim buckley. hmmm not interested. :)
Time After Time 	this is so bad acting This seems to be a real big shit freddie stroma needed a break he jas the charisma! Really want to see this series in the UK. Anyone have it ripped onto DVD? Well we sill have dancing with the sluts Welcome to 2017 good show dumped again stupid series. all he has to do is travel back and not tell his friends about the time machine Such a shame this was axed. Looks so good Haven't seen the show and it looks like I never will, since it's been axed. Was curious about it, cuz I'm a fan of the original '79 film. But it looks to me from this promo that the show should have been sold to the WB network - kinda has that teenage/tweenage feel to it. No believable maturity to it, fashion magazine model-types in the roles... But, like I said... haven't seen the show, so maybe I'm being too quick to judge. Hope somebody posts the pilot and few eps on YouTube. Cancelled after 5 shows.It's the golden age of television folks. I saw the original 1979 movie and am looking forward to seeing this. So far it is not on UK satellite TV channels so I am wondering if the pilot episode is out on DVD as a TV movie? Back in 1993 I think it was they made a movie along similiar lines where Sherlock Holmes freezes himself and is woken up in San Fransisco in 1994, where he then proceeds to solve a case involving a descendant of  Professor Moriarty who is a crime lord. ...Aren't there worse people than Jack the Ripper nowadays? S C A R Y They live I still prefer the movie of 70's. moving in time takes the time machine from london to new york? i would like to see this move
Tom Horn 	Such a good movie and one of Steve McQueen's best. Wish it was on Blu-ray. this movie was so historically inaccurate it not even funny T.Horn a hero?These Americanilazed movies made for sissies ,breeders,,benefits cheaters etc make me feel sick.He was a serial killer,an hired gun,a hobo. Fantastic and highly underrated western! McQueen was fantastic as Tom Horn!
Too Far to Go 	Just watched this movie, great movie. GOSH sad to think of the level of IGNORANCE in LONDON its another level. People really need to get onto whats important GET AN EDUCATION. This is the stupidest archaic racist movie I've ever seen. These black kids are ashamed of their heritage this movie is embarrassing. whats the song in the beginning. ? Way too cool... 'we don't speak to people who can't talk English '  retarded. it's speak .the light-skinned girl made a fool of herself This trailer is better than the Film. lol this movie looks dope Most of this was filmed in peckham I live here lol Had never heard of this when I stumbled upon it the other week on Film4: must have missed the 1st 3rd or so. Very entertaining and the closing scene was just hilarious!!! Would really love to see it the whole way through. What is that song ???? Hahaaa very funny and interesting movie  Nice one Destiny, you are an eye opener for me Haha! Looks funny!It's fun to watch how embarrassing an extremely extroverted person can be.And also contradictory: those kind of people are usually lovely!But, indeed, the accents are a killer to me. =] I tried to watch this shit, but these niggas accent gave me a headache.
Torn Between Two Lovers 	haha loser The whole movie :) Joaquin is a amazing actor!! very good movie,very sad story:( whats the opening female opera song? this movie takes a really long time to get going, embarrassingly slow and dull the first 40 minutes, but something remarkable happens at the 3/4 mark, Gwyneth has a transcendent scene up on the roof, then the end is acceptable, not bad, but not terribly imaginative. AHHH! YOU SPOILED THE MOVIE FOR ME! i'm glad he chose sandra farahkhanum, Club song.....
Jussi Bjorling - Una Furtiva Lacrima 	Does anyone know the name of the song at 1:04  ? Does anyone know the name of the song, which they dance in the disco ? Michelle was the woman that he was more physically attracted to and she was more unpredictable and spontaneous which he liked because he was stuck in a planned out, boring life.  Sandra was the safe bet, a sure thing, but she was willing to love him in a way that Michelle couldn't and once Leonard realized that he knew Sandra would make him more happy.  The message at the end was positive because love should always conquer lust. what do you think about the ending? I watch this movie last night and I think at the end he understands he made a mistake falling in love with Michelle, because it was just a sort of dream in his mind and he realized he could be even happier with Sandra, that is a very sensitive and intelligent woman. So the ending was quite positive in my opinion, while my boyf thinks it's really bitter because he accepts to stay with Sandra just bec he can't have Mich, without any love... Opinions? una furtiva lagrima pavarotti movie is good. shitty ending march
Tourist Trap 	Looks shit There really is something quite creepy about mannequins ! its seeing their eyes move as the first female victim walks around , bbbrrrrr! Compass films who released this, also released Halloween , so they knew their mad killers well ! really underrated film , which is sad , as it's a really decent horror film I just watched this move last night.. And I was high... This movie was the scariest movie I've  ever seen... I'm still freaking out.. Now I'm pretty sure it's cause I was high and this movie is probably stupid in rl... I'm gonna watch it again sober lol haha this is supposedly to comedy why horror ! that hahaha manequine waay too funny ! I wonder why I haven't seen this movie then again this movie is way before my time. Gotta love old horror trailers, where they announce the title about 30 times. why he want to shave her? this movie is PG! Traumatized me so bad when I was a kid! What's this movie about? Horror movies that were scary when I was a child is  comedies today haha :) I watched it again and didn't seem as terribly creepy as it seemed when I was little, it gave me nightmares for a long time! This movie since i was a kid has made me forever be frightened by mannequin dolls...... even tho they are not real they sure as hell are freaky looking..... i wish my brother george was here BIRTHDAY CAKE FACE!!!! :-DDD Strange slasher film This looks exponentially better than the ho-hum gore porn that's polluting the horror industry today. My opera recooooorrrds! COVERED IN CUM! this movie is really under-rated, it's so good Moooooolly
Transplant 	How did I ever sit through this as a kid in the 70's? This cheesy fest gave me the creeps as a kid. I don't understand.  How did Patton beat this movie for best picture? Saw this on late night TV way back in the 70s as a kid. Damm! I loved old late night shocker TV shows back then. I;m 50 now,I was a kid watching and loving monster films as a 8 to 10 year old in the 70s! A Clockwork Orange wins best film of 1971 sorry Wtf so bad this was the original THE THING WITH TWO HEADS..nyuk nyuk nyuk.......casey kasem should have been one of the heads......this movie is soooooo bad, it's good!! thanks for posting! The dude on the left looks like John Candy. bruce dern is the man!! But how is this superb effect made ;-))
The Triangle Factory Fire Scandal 	I remember seeing this year's ago and my mother told me that these people had no idea how to put a fire out or how to exit now I know why fire drills are important The full movie was uploaded here a few years ago but has since been removed which is odd because apart from one hugely overpriced used copy of an original issue available on Amazon, and various pirated offerings on auction sites, an official dvd appears to be entirely unavailable. I downloaded to a disc from that upload just in time but the production was so well done that I just couldn't watch to the end once the horror starts. Still would like to see the whole movie In the movie it was the faulty bulb but from what I heard it may have been from a cigarette ash that fell into a pile of clippings or maybe a spark from one of the machines Please, could anybody upload the full movie? It is a great movie...wish someone would upload the entire movie...this is the BEST version I've seen it's was the sparks from the light bulb that burned out that started the fire What a great role. I love Olivia. Hugs, Katy
Up from the Depths 	what music did you use in this intro? "Your vacation is about to end." Best tag line ever.
Van Nuys Blvd. 	I actually saw this in the theater in 1979. I was a teenager. cyndi gives me wood. My childhood ! Cynthia Wood (0:45) was Moon. She also appeared in "Apocalypse Now" as "Playmate of the Year", and she was a real Playboy PotY in 1974. My vision of heaven for all eternity!!! RIP Dennis Bowen. For the first time since 2011, Wednesday cruise night on Van Nuys Boulevard is back!!June 17th, 7PMhttps://instagram.com/p/4AD6mzj_W_/ Cruisin' just aint what it used to be (smh). Times were better back then. As were the cars. Crazy to see how radically the valley has changed FUN One of my favorite movies. Long live the Chooch.....................and don't call him a creep, man! Van nuys is nasty now.Even moving there in the mid 90s it looked nice then I moved around 05 and came back..12,it was sad. When I was there old van nuys was still around and it was cleaner. No such thing as god it's all made up You should be loving people like me because I provide the government paycheck that allows you,your boyfriend,your supposed wife and mother of your thirty kids to buy the toilet paper from Dollar Tree so you can all wipe your filthy asses and throw it in the garbage can because you're uneducated pieces of garbage with the morals of a gnat... Cholos destroyed Van Nuys :D get over it crackers Why should he move out?Dirty welfare scumbags come in and wreck the area and destroy the quality of life and decent law abiding dignified people should move out because they're upset?I don't think so asshole.Get rid of the "welfraud" scum not the good people. Illegal immigration, that's what happened. Alot of stuff happened there. Many people got murdered. About a month ago a old homeless woman got burned and almost died, and a homeless young man passed away on a bustop bench.

Voices 	Everyone:"This movie leaves you hanging".. No. After the ending he escapes, changes his name to Wade, then joins the Special Forces. I love dark comedies,  this movie took a much darker turn than I expected,  I liked it haha Really really disturbing but really well done and worth watching *sees title & Anna* oh another singing movie?*sees cat & dog talking* oh.. I get it, a funny movie where a guy talks to animals.*sees him kill someone* WHAT IS THIS MONSTROSITY! What the fuck did I just watch? I'm so glad I saw this film because it was so enjoyable. It made me run through several emotions and you just want the character to find happiness. Great acting by Ryan as well i loved it so much I love this movie, it's great This movie is great I hate movies which leave things up in the air. Were all those cops inside killed when the gas exploded? It seems so, but it's not certain. It may seem like a detail to them but not to all of us. Amazingly at least one of them was female. That never happens. Usually when something like that happens they make sure to have all the cops be males at that moment. They might show a female cop now and then, but rarely have one killed. It seemed this was no exception at first since they had the psychiatrist escorted out by one (or two?) of the female cops. That's usually how it goes. They will show female cops, but they end up being away from the scene when it's time to show some cops killed.  This one had at least one inside when the explosion occurred. That's a major break from how it is 99.9% of the time. Same goes for security guards or paramedics or firefighters. this movie gave me nightmares. there is nothing funny about it. unless you consider mental illness to be funny. wtf is this shit !! I watched this when I was a little high last night. i thought it was god damn terrifying. Was it just me or is this movie actually scary? I still can't believe the author of Persepolis directed this if anyone is thinking of seeing this for the dark comedy like idk "Mr. Right"? Dont. Cuz its just so depressing... Great movie but... depressing as hell This was sadder than I expected Wade's life before Deadpool. why make a movie with gemma arterton without her body in it ? Anna Kendrick looks like the girl avatar from Xbox
Walk Proud 	this movie takes me back. i remember i was in an Asian gang when i was in high school. i wanted to get out when i found out they were going to do a shooting. i left town. later i found out they actually did it and many got locked up. im 34 now and my old "gang members" are still in prison today. there is so much to my story i cant tell but i can understand what the main character went through. getting out of that gang was the hardest choice i ever had.. that was almost 20 years ago and now i notice all that was so stupid.. Amazing how dumb and stupid we were when we were young.
The Wanderers 	chingesumadrefortelecemepadre mira mira I'll stick that baseball bat up your ass and turn you into a basketball They need to put this out on Bluray CAN YOU DIG IT!!!!!!!!!!! fallout 4 THIS along with....The Outsiders.And...The Warriors.Made me soooo HappyLove Novel-To-Movie stuff Love this movie! Wish I could have been in this movie.
The Warriors 	Whats the title of the song  playing? I like watching this at 2 in the morning with soda chips and ice cream rockstar brought me here gubigvi fidhhbidffggggggg This 1970s gang movie was based on a 1960s novel. The novel was actually inspired by the ancient Greek story, Anabassis. In the original story, a group of Greek soldiers is marooned in the Middle East after a peace conference goes wrong. Similar to "The Warriors", they must travel and fight through hostile territory in order to return to their ocean side home. this is an amazing movie I watched it and I played the game I am a huge fan of the warriors can you dig it got love these fucks and there 666-999 tags This is the movie pretty much every beat 'em up game of the 80's/90's got their inspiration from. riff A MOVER EL COOLO :V A MOVER EL COOLO! cyrus this is a cult movie now fuck febreeze never buy it ... LYSOL the way to go,,, Wish the original version was still easy to find If you start it at 0:30 it sounds like he's screaming "hey you niggers!" geniL
When Hell Was in Session 	I saw this movie once, when it was shown in 1979.  God, I can't believe it was that long ago. I LOVE THIS MOVIE IT TOOK GUTS AND A LOT OF FAITH FOR NAVY COMMANDER JEREMIAH TO ENDURE THE ORDEAL AS A POW AND TO SURVIVE AND RETURN HOME. MY PRAYERS FOR ALL OUR VIETNAM VETERANS I LOVE YOU AND THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE! I hate the fact the fact that people can analyse hurt when aware another person is screaming in pain. Point of note. The A-6 Intruder did not have machine guns, only bombs, missiles and rockets. In fact the Intruder was an attack aircraft and did not have any defensive weapons at all. I hate when Hollywood misses simple details and thinks the audience is to stupid to know. Well that was not a good made for TV movie, "The Hanoi Hilton" was a waaay better movie. U look like tony stark A great man.  A God-awful movie. Hal Holbrook is magnificent in his portrayal of Commander Denton! I saw this movie as a young teen and was so moved by the experiences of those brave soldiers. Thank you for sharing. All throughout this movie the poem, Invictus, was stuck in my mind"Out of the night that covers me,Black as the pit From pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul." I have been looking for this movie, I was aboard the ship when he flew off on this mission Nice upload, thanks so much for this. yeah I'm looking for Pueblo too. Anyone? Anybody got Ha Holbrook's other Pow movie "Pueblo" (1973)???
When She Was Bad...	 Now that was 1:35 minutes I will never get back.... What an astounding piece of acting u can clearly tell the child was not raised correctly so blame the child's attitude on the parent's, but they def r horrible parents wow! DAMN I'm thankful for my parents especially my mom. I LOVE U MOMMY!!  (Hope ur reading This LOL!) Idk were I would b without her! people make me feel blamed on because they do . When I'm in a situation where a friend is near me and I talk  o him he gets anoyed be me I also follow but I'm not trying to be annoying Ijust want to talk to him he blames me. Preschoolers in general act out, abused or not. Some act out worse than others. But she is only supposed to be around 4 years old. They act out and throw fits and try and get what they want. Its a hard age but no kid deserves to get abuse as a response. You have to know how to cope with preschoolers. at least she realized she had a problem that's always the first step is recognizing good movie eye opening but also sad good movie Q so sad... I think the father who needs that brain injury.... he's a selfish dick son of a bitch just like my exh who's never listened to me or to my children.... husbands like him dnt deserve a chance becuz believe me they dnt deserve it .. nomatter wat u sacrifice for them they won't change!!!! I think the father who needs that brain injury.... he's a selfish dick son of a bitch just like my exh who never listened to me or to my children.... husbands like him dnt deserve a chance becuz believe me they dnt deserve it .. nomatter wat u sacrifice for them they won't change!!!! Had my children really young. Wanted so badly to have a family like  my friends had. My first choice was a bad one. Needless to say I got out of that relationship when a table legs flew across the hall almost hitting him. My second choose a few years later and some therapy was a wonderful man and we had 24 great years together.  My mother was an emotional abuser. Name caller. Told my father horrible stories about me. I was ganged molested and all she said was to get downstairs before someone seen me. A week later I tried to kill myself. My patents were well know. In the community so she convinced them I had been drinking and was unsure hoenmanuninhsd taken. For years I waited for an apology. And finally after my first grandsons were born I got one. I had built up that day so high in ,my head and how I was going to shove that apology right into her face. But I couldn't. She was sober now. Sober and seeking therapy for herself. I knew deep down she truly feels bad for all the things she out me thru and blaming me for being assaulted. Eventually we worked on our therapy together. Bringing in my father who was an enabler as well as a e AMAZING MOVIE narcissist married to a workaholic emotionally unavailable pratt...what a lethal combination. Poor kid wow . you guys actually watched this movie ?? . with the poor quality ?? LMAO , you guys are winners ..ALL OF YOU  hahaha LMFBO at first I thought the kid was a brat but if you watch the whole movie you realize the mom is bat shit crazy and the husband is an ass I felt so bad for the kid I'd have murdered that kid if she were mine. Agonizing movie. She needs help. Why have kids when you can't control yourself...jeez.. When She Was Dad
Wise Blood 	Brad, Will you marry me??? I love you, Billy Bibbit!!! And I just drive thru Macon g.a. and went along the films path as it was in the movie. That city looks the same as it did in 1979. except they was a lot of blacks and crime in that little city in bibb county. "Listen, dig this! Nobody with a good car needs to worry about nothin', do you understand? Nobody with a good car needs to be justified. And I'll tell you why. I come a long way since I believed in anything and I come halfway around the world."Stanton: "What are you talking about?" Dourif: "Where you came from is gone, where you thought you were going weren't never there and where you are ain't no good unless you can get away from it..."Very wise words........... great movie Excolente film and has a strange kind of rhythm to it but very addicting One of the best movies ever made. Reputed to be Huston's favorite among the movies he made. The movie is black humor, about the blackest humor ever made. Incredibly interesting and the best performances of numerous of the actors. the book was not silly or goofy like the erroneous music for this trailer suggests Love this movie I love Flanerry O'Connor, but you're totally correct for saying Atheism is not nihilism. Likewise, the people who don't believe are not nihilistic. It's only the Protestants suffering from a crisis of faith who actually start to believe in nihilism. Same. I thought of him as extremely intense in Wise Blood; never smiling, hardly every even blinking. In the original book, that's not exactly what O'Connor is claiming. Her critique is more so about nihilism as an end result in the Protestant crisis of faith. If you read the book closely, it's clear Hazel never really stopped believing - the whole entire novel is about an inability to form a negation from Jesus. Hazel still believes in the Church and God; he literally says the Church is Protestant. And he literally mimics Jesus in his last few days. First saw this recently. Very quirky. Seemed a bit time out of place. He ain't blind! Ministry psalm 69 this movie kicks ass.  Gods ass.  Blackest comedy ever made. I don't remember it being a knockabout comedy. From the book I pictured Hazel with a deeper Southern accent, and I imagined him crazier but still not too bad.  My PaPaw (Grandpa) was the 1 armed Wrecker Driver!
The Wobblies 	THOSE who paved the path for www.15now.org  right here in this FINE, friendly  reminder This is what America needs now. Solidarity! You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown Well that's a start, does anyone have the actual special in it's entirety that premiered on CBS? With commercials and promos? Yeah yeah I'm obsessed with the stuff that people skip, so's the nostalgia 'critic I have this special on my recorded blank VHS tape from 1998 of peanuts on Nickelodeon, snoopy double feature v1 VHS, and remastered you're a good sport Charlie Brown DVD Wow-a roughly filmed promo-even by standards in 1979 by any network (with an taped station id). Such an amazing piece of television history with Danny Dark announcing the promo. i have this episode on tape Then during the 1980's Peanuts strips Marcie frequently takes her glasses off while in school. That ending shocked a lot of people, lol! That may've been the 1st time we saw Marcie's eyes, but it wasn't the only time. I saw in 1 of the comics Peppermint Patty told Marcie to take her glasses off because then she'd look "sophisticated". Then Marcie, without her glasses on, bumped into a tree I remember watching this special on Nickelodeon too, in 1998 for the first time during the "Snoopy Bowl" weekend. I had that on tape and on the remastered DVD.
Zulu Dawn 	I'd watch a movie like this when I was younger and think "Horrible Zulus killing all those brave soldiers." Then I got older and realized they were only protecting their country. The Brits and the French did horrible things in Africa. We're still paying for it today. very good film, the battle scenes are epic and very well staged, its a good prelude to the film "Zulu" with Michael Caine and Stanley Baker, knowing that there is no hope for the British forces in Zulu Dawn make it a relentless heart stopping encounter with blame for the defeat laid squarely at the feet of the arrogant Lord Chelmsford played by Peter O'Toole. Not sur ehow accurate his character is but it makes good drama. So does this film's events take place before Zulu? still no where as good as the 1st erm 4000 strong Chelmsford = idiot Tony Jay is the narrator? DAMN! What if 45,856 marines went back in time with 7,200 tanks/armored vehicles, 4,485 helicopters and 80,730,936 rounds of ammunition/grenades to 1879 during the Zulu War? And what weapons and tactics will the marines use when they encounter any Zulu warriors? it is an amazing movie.............well directed......nice scrrenplay Does anybody know the name of the music that starts at 0:56? I really need to know! It would be a big help if somebody could tell me. Why does everyone call it a terrible movie? It's not Zulu, sure, but it's still good, seeing all the uniforms and the column moving, the impending sense of disaster, and then the battle where everyone is overran and killed. It's a great little flick. I think it's stingy the way whoever released Zulu Dawn wouldn't even allow the battle 'clips' on Youtube, the latter should tell them to get stuffed in not doing that! Terrific film. Feels more authentic than the original and is more historically accurate. I just wish they had a few more black extras to play the zulus, it looked more like 500 or so in the battle scene, rather than 20,000 My favorite part is where the Zulus escaped from prison. They ran out of money whilst making the film, certain things were left badly done as a result. Even after filming, people weren't paid! i'm sure if about 30,000 Zulus were assembled for the making of "Zulu dawn." there didn't seem to be that many when I saw the battle scene at the end. Nice. i did a remake of this using Napoleon total war! Watch:  /watch?v=MwhswOKuj9k Looks like there was some kind of foul up by not supplying the troops with ammo quickly enough
Breaker Morant 	0:12 I would say it there was more to it than that, the Boers were just as ambitious as the British. why watch the film the trailer has told all the story this is what war is about. I stumbled upon this film accidentally, and it has become one of my favorites. I've watched 5 or 6 times already. I can't get enough of a good story with superb acting. Boers, or from the dutch; Boeren; Prenounced like Booeren Great movie. love the voice over guy. @jedq yep about the boar war and the court martial of an Australian Officer under English command for the murder of prisoners, Great film one of my faves is this a bore war film about english army vs bores @Tralman1965 I agree. Edward Woodward died in 2008 - he did a number of really good films. @Docmate That is just as well now because his site has been taken down.  I fancied watching it again the other night as well.....!! @alanheath3 already have it on DVD Someone has posted the whole film on you tube.  I can't remember the channel but I am sure you can find it. @FiendsInRedSatin1 yep i agree @Tralman1965 One of my fav Aussie War dramas based on real events. Edward Woodward was a great actor. R.I.P A very well-acted movie.
Act of Love 	Very touching, unconditional father love im crying thank goodness for ppl like him :) amen :)
Airplane! I speak jive! 	Thumbs down if you came from an Economist article. Whose here from the United Airlines memes? i just realized leslie nielsen and steve martin are not the same person old movies had humor today we got EMOJI movie yay horray tecnology I've never seen this...I'm glad I haven't...they gave away some of the best bits! 2017 I watched I never saw that movie and this trailer made me laught a lot. puts the movies of today to shame. I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Funniest movie I ever seen in my life. I just watched it yesterday I never realized how many references I missed in other shows leading back to this movie. Funniest Movie ever! The best movie about autism ever. Reminds me of the humor in the Angie Tribeca tv show. Love that kind of humor. Never beat these comedy spoofs! I miss 1980. Shit.
Alcatraz 	ho dei vuoti di memoria mi piacerrebbe il finale nelle altre stagioni Such a GREAT Show!!!! Please bring it back!!!! Great series... Miss it alot! Too bad the show was canceled... i guess you have killed the producers by now? JORGE GARCIA Is on this show he is hilarious on the show Lost. Mob of the dead Mob of the dead Well I've seen 10 episodes or so, still dont like it.It's like a lame CSI, every episode a different killer that has to be caught, with a (not very interesting)  weird story trying to connect all the episodes together. This show should come back one of the best tv shows dont understand why not everyone watched it  On the other hand I had that with boardwalk empire too, and that just kept getting better and better. Maybe I should give it a chance I liked lost, but this does nothing for me.I'm trying to like it but it's hard, I feel like I'm watching a soap?? Download: filmtied.com/Alcatraz#af=AA72uk1FsXeOb This needs Season 2! HUGOOO! dude ;D Why was this cancelled?! WHY?! My life became knowing what happened in this series, and now.... :'( everyone just shut up, we can all agree on one thing; HURLEY IS AWESOME.  Why did you say 'thank you'....? WWWWWooooooooooowwwwww..... no offence, but i saw two episodes and i think it lacks the quality fringe had, J j Abrams should have done better!
The Aliens Are Coming 	The scenes with those two aliens looking at the veiwscreen in their ship looks like the same sort of scene we often see featuring Kang and Kodos from, "The Simpsons" why the aliens haven't come yet to our boring, mundane planet?... or , are we really alone in this vast universe ?.. This NBC movie of the week was a possible TV pilot,which was obviously passed!although at the time,QM Productions was a Taft Broadcating unit,which Quinn Martin sold to them in 1979. but course,this type of material is nothing new to Martin,who in1967 had launched "THE INVADERS" on ABC-TV,which was WAY better then this movie/pilot! the interesting thing about this TV movie,was the use of certain sound effects,which were originally used on "LOST IN SPACE",since many of the electronicsound fx were the ones that Ralph Hickey created at 20th Century Fox decades ago!the "Alien UFO" used the same sound effects of "The Jupiter 2" spaceship,and alsofrom "THE TIME TUNNEL" TV series,so that was about the only thing that was goodon this failed pilot,,it could've been better! It has Albert from Little House in it!  I will watch it no matter how cheesy it is now! The TV Guide reviewer at the time described the alien leader in this as looking like a jar of olives. Underrated reboot of The Invaders, which ought to have gone to series based purely on the charisma of (who would have been) the series leads - Tom Brady, Melinda Fee and Eric Braeden.  Sadly, there are some typically late 70s goofy moments in it that ruin it. Overall, a MUCH better set up for a sci fi show than anything else of its' time, probably 86'd by bad promotion. Kind of half baked reboot of The Invaders, the classic series also by QM Is this a porn film??? Just watched this on The Horror Channel, UK. Really enjoyed it and loved the music, too. They even have the same fellow who narrated "The Invaders" doing the voiceover! Catchy title, LOL.  I missed this one when it was broadcast. Omg, i remember seeing this in 1980 as a kid....i think it was on NBC, not sure! :)
All's Well That Ends Well 	Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. If I could dance across the Atlantic, I'd have a seat front and center. RSC trailers give my day depth and light-headed intensity. Great trailer
Alligator 	I remember this shown on television when I was a kid my friend is going to watch this movie today ikr 1:19 "Alligator" Resident Evil 2. God, I remember this film all right. One of my favorite nature runs amok movies! My favorite Jaws rip-off. I remember seeing this when I was kid. it scared the hell out of me. 01:17  that is some serious pussy biting ! Carnosaur vs alligator lmao I love alligators! They are so freaking cute!! But I respect them, they deserve to be left alone, unless they are at a perseverance and need help. So remember if you see a gator in the wild, don't go towards it trying to harm it or pet it. Leave the animal be, it won't hurt you if you don't hurt it. Is it really a Dinosaur movie? Otro descendiente de Jaws.Los cocodrilos y caimanes en el alcantarillado de Nueva York fue una leyenda urbana muy popular. Y esta hasta tuvo segunda parte. Alligator bite the pussy of the woman Urban Legend. Godzilla's cousin! Magnitudes of Awesomeness that today's Hollywood can't touch!! Yawn....another variation on Jaws. THEY SHOULD DO A REMAKE OF THIS MOVIE. Still better than lake placid
Altered States 	0:57... "That stacks up in the brain worse than"... What he say?? decent sci fi movie but a little overrated in my opinion.  the mexican mushroom part of this movie was cool and intense but then i dont like the direction it took after that when the guy started messing around with turning to an ape.  this movie got sort of boring in my humble opinion after 45 - 50 minutes into it but i stuck it out and watched the whole thing. its worth a watch but i was expecting something a little more fascinating than what i saw DMT such a great movie, one of my favorites My God Trailers were so fucking awesome in the 80s Came here after watching House, Sesion 4, Ep 15 this movie = the fly, but he turns into a goofy caveman instead of a giant mutant insect monster. Who came from a website suggesting films that can cure Stranger Things-withdrawal syndrome? Joe Rogan This movie was awesome i remember seeing it maybe 10 years ago when a freind i lived with hired it out from the video shop, he was really good at picking movies :D Saw this at the theater when it was released.  Loved it then.  Forgot about it until I started watching 'Fringe.' i love this movie Probably the most unsettling scene IMO is when they do the x-rays after he takes the stuff and is aphasic. That was scary. Wonderful and underrated movie Could have been an interesting movie but combining a script holding ten times more dialogue than needed with the *screamiest direction of all time* killed it. Such an underrated Science Fiction classic. This needs to be a Blu Ray release if it hasn't yet! These Nobel prize winners...always ripped, always smart. BWAAAA horns before Inception made it popular I actually like the romantic side of this movie, some great life lessons
American Gigolo 	I own the OST and though the theme is similar it is not the same as the opening theme from this clip. The internet says its possibly the early mix from "Man Music" which was the pre-cursor to Palm Springs Drive/Call me. Anybody else had any luck finding this version off the preview? J aime ... ce couple represente selon moi le couple ideal kisss Richard Gere would've been a perfect James Bond. "I know you like me, I know u like your pet gerbils. I'm going to make them disappear" and that's why they called him Johnny Anis looked like a great Jeans Commercial. I finally found out what this song is in the trailer: It is "Palm Springs Drive" by Georgio Moroder. Someone said it is the reprise to "Call Me" which was a good guess except for the fact there is no track listing of a reprise for "Call Me". It has to be an earlier version of the "Palm Springs" track because if you listen to it on the OST, it has the same rhythm and feel but is slightly modified. The mix of Giorgio Moroder's beautiful soundtrack to the shots of Beverly Hills to the charm of Richard Gere is what made this film for me! Love love love it! what a charming style! A classic elegant that make me crazy every time I watch he,even I'm a man! Better no imagine the effect if I should be a woman... B-) the most famous romantic hero of all time is this song in any bootleg or reprise soundtrack? Not true.  Check out the Showtime show Gigolos and do some Googling--there are a lot of straight male escorts these days, to meet the demands of busy working women. Anybody notice the turnaround between American Gigolo and Pretty Woman, along with the fact that both movies are exactly ten years apart? His name is Johnny A sounds like an instrumental version of Blondie's Call Me. Anybody know what the song in the trailer is? Good to know... I just bought it but haven't watched it yet! Richard Gere still going strong. That movie Arbitrage was damn good.  You've Got to be Kidding ...
Angel City 	0:28 "Jack Cooper Wanted" solid 10/10 As a scorch and ion main, I want to have that executions so much. Respawn: hey erm benchy could you uhBenchy: say no more these pilots must of watched frothyomen I bought every fucking thing wich was purchasable, to support you. I don't care about these prime titans (except the executions), but i think you deserve the support. What a great game, and even underrated! However, keep going, you got a great community and a great game, and your community WILL become bigger, i promise. You will be number 1 in gaming. Forget about call of duty. Here comes Titanfall. I would watch a Titanfall film series New Titan? It's nice to see a classic Respawn why dose the inter pics. don't look as blood in game like your trailer? man, why don't you add the old maps back. like Lagoon, Rise, Boneyard, Airbase, etc.. those were good For the love of god just use a KB&M to show off gameplay. It's painful watching stiff gameplay in trailers. Everything is so much slower and so stiff. It just doesn't look good when you show gameplay with a controller. I got Titanfall 2 awhile go and it's bloody amazing games way to fast n chaotic shit how hardly anyone on ps4 1:00Thank you can someone tell me what's the soundtrack? Take me into your arms schorch Respawn since the patch (and even before the patch) i did not play angel city on any mode... its like its removed??? is it??  If not u should really change the maprotation!I mean angel city is my favorite map, i didnt want to play it game after game in ANGELCITY 24/7... but when i start attrition it wont come aswell (or in other gamemodes)... hopefully u can fix this! "Angel city is back" "For free" *Spits coffee* my favorite map minus all the camping pussies and roof top faggots
Any Which Way You Can 	In the movie, "Black Samson", William Smith was guilty of 'stomach turning bigotry', which was why he should "NOT" have been allowed to be in a decent movie like this one. 2:02 - there is NOTHING funnier than someone getting kicked in the balls!!!!
The Apple 	Why does this movie-cal feel like Rocky Horror's cousin from the wrong side of the tracks trying to get you to do bad things that are even worse than the bad things you're doing already? The Apple, prequel to The Nightman Cometh! This shit's got me all fucked up! Barbarella meets Grease...absolute mess Ahhh... back when Christians thought that Rock Opera would be an effectivel means of evangelizing. I wonder how many atheists this movie created by the end? The gayest movie ever. Even Attack of the Killer Tomatoes wasn't this shit I want to watch this film!!! But I can't!!! :( Jews are so degenerate. Sheesh. I just saw this movie.. If the objective was to make the worst movie  the history of mankind, they have succeeded.. . Some movies are so bad that they are good, this movie is so bad,  that it is bad. Watching this made me very update. A nearly three minute trailer?! It's like "Hair" if it were directed by Kenneth Anger. What's amazing is how uncannily accurate it was in depicting the world of 1994. How Did This Get Made brought me here! Who else is going to the show this Saturday? And to think that the guy who made this movie also made that piece of chit movie "Delta Force." glitter-ghost brought me here Illuminati!!!!  : P This movie makes "Xanadu" look like "Singin' in the Rain". RiffTrax brought me here. What the ****?!!
Attica 	You don't have a link to the full movie do you? well???? where is the rest? ATTICA! ATTICA! morgan freeman always seems so smart in these prison films, but if he was so smart then why the hell would he be in them?! sick Fuck the criminals Esta  muy buena Left there in 2010. Yes, it was Lima State Hospital at the time. I worked there at the time and a lot of us served as extras on our days off, Just for a lark who was the Irishman? LMAO You clearly weren't born in the 60's were you? Or even for the matter of fact have you ever seen footage of what white people done to black people? Well when the blacks protested for their rights the whites hosed them down and beat them. They deserve their rights just like us. America never was, never has and never will be a one race country, i hope you realize that it was founded by an Irish man who discovered "Indians" living there and may i add they weren't white! So this is what went down before Andy got there... Can someone direct me to where I can see the full film online for free?  Attica! Attica!  Is there any way to get the full lenght of his movie????? My brother play a part in this i would like to show it to my kids they never got to meet their uncle..... Yes, fuck you! do you have the full length version of this movie because I wanted to show it to my kids since my dad played an extra on this movie as one of the football players in the prison yard seen. As another person who has studied civil rights lets discuss this, ever heard of beat whitey night in iowa? There have been SEVENTY reported hate criems since the trayvon martin case including three killing spawned by the trayvon martin case. i know this dusturbs youre world view White =evil black =good, BUT IT IS REALLY FUCKING AWFUL. White reciepients of violence rarely if ever get coverage because the media wants to focus on cases like trayvon martin. You CANNOT see thsi because it aint PC!
The Awakening 	this is actually very good. why many can't grasp the story in this charming angst-horror-romantic movie, I have no idea.....*sigh Spoiler don't read this comment! Please can someone please explain the movie to me like was she dead or was she a ghost?? chilling it was OK don't really understand it is everyone is this movie dead except for u an in the is she really dead whays the story about? I thoroughly enjoyed this film! Love this film, what do you think? Monica, you should've typed Spoiler Alert first! You gave away the surprise! :-( What's the  name of the children's ryme in this movie  called ? Robert Killed himself??----when?? i think i missed the part 2 of the saga..Nice trivia bytheway. OK..and the ghosts use taxis, and smoke..and bla bla bla...look, she say hello at the end. And the ghosts write books. After she said..Not seeing them is not the same that forgetting...till saturday week.... watch the movie again.....AND LOOK WHO IS THE PERSON THAT GAVE HER THE ANTIDOT...the old woman drunk all the poison..( surpriseee) she didn't. No...she talks with 3 people at the end. 2 children one man. Amazing Stuff ~ no.. this is not a trailer...THIS IS THE ENTIRE MOVIE..... come on...don't show everything onnthe trailers... THIS MOVIE WAS WORSE THAN "TWILIGHT"!!!!!! >( Dead. is she alive or dead in the end??
The Babysitter 	What's the song at the beginning (0:07) ? I can't find is in the soundtrack... Hmmm I was looking for the upcoming Disney channel movie,but they gave me this junk Katherine Waterston is so hot! Sluts are awesome. Shit they made a movie bout this yo that's practically my life story 8=D~          Fuckbigsisfolif The movie was interesting... but totally sick and twisted. Idk who comes up with stuff like that cause it is so messed up. I recommend not letting kids under 17 watching this for sure. Good thing it's rated R. I'm gonna go watch something else now to get my mind off this movie... lol The babysitter = Babysitters black book This is a pretty messed up movie. Don't watch.   Alguien sabe donde la puedo ver desde mi cel John Leguizamo <3 i love the movie and the sexy girls in it.
Battle Beyond the Stars 	This is a Star Wars rip off shameless The BootyStar Testicula is approaching. Cheap Star Wars rip off. I always thought George Peppard pouring his drinks from his belt buckle was so futuristic! Starship Nell should have been a triangle Starfighter ship Wow. The years really have not been kind to this movie. "Go down like a Valkyrie!" Ah, another memory of the 80s...I remember liking how the ship's interior would light up wherever JohnBoy walked around inside it. As a kid who was taught to always turn off the lights when leaving a room, I thought this feature was very energy-conscious at the time.I guess this is how they kept the special FX staff employed for a bit after Battlestar Galactica went off the air. Hey, if the talent is there, you might as well use it. vaguely remember it, very battle star gallactica. this is basically the Magnificent Seven in Outer Space. Fun to watch @ 0:55 MK3 Subzero. Played by none other than John Saxon from Enter the motherfucking Dragon! when is someone going to re-make this movie? RIP, James Horner. This movie won the Oscar for best picture in 1980. JAMES HORNER! 1953 - 2015 A film about war in space? What a ridiculous idea. How does this compare to Red Dwarf? lol I saw this when I was a young buck maybe about 8 or 9 yrs old. From what I remember it was actually way better than a lot of the scifi flicks I had seen back then. Gonna watch it in a tiny bit and I hope it's still badass. If you own a copy of this, send it to Red Letter Media for an episode of Best of the Worst.
Beyond Evil 	cool music LOL Saxon's best film 1:36 damn I didn't know this was a laser party!!! PEW-PEW-PEW-PEWPEW!!!! Lol Possessed people shooting laser out of their eyes? I quit this shit! everybody is falling from everywhere the music is more horror ! isnt this house in Vegas somewhere..TVM's old place..??? The scary part of this movie is the I remeber going to the Orpheum Theatre in downtown L.A. and spending my allowance on what I now realize was a really bad film!! Fun going down memory lane though; thanks for the laughs! BTW: I was a huge John Saxon fan back in the day! 1:20 I don't always take part in Exorcisms, but when I do, I prefer dos equis 0:40 the guy from mega 64 !!! lol ! Bearded old dude says "As long as your wife remains within her reach, she's in danger of contamination" and then they show that he's talking to a woman. Love how the evil music stops long enough to hear the neck snap. Watch the trailer to RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART II  sounds like what your describing... Does anyone know the name of an old horror movie from the 90's with some demonic tombtone with flashing green lights, and people that were inhaling this toxic or poisonous gas that, standing still like some freaking zombies, just inhaling that toxic smoke or gas, having their eyes turned over their heads..... that movie scarred me in the 90's a a little 6 year old..... i'm searching for 10 years now, but no clue.... must be one of those old forgotten horror movies, but i remember being awesome! Lmao, hilarious!  GreenLaseers!!!!!!!!
The Big Red One Horton 	trailer. Good movie Optimus Prime And Luke Skywalker. YES. what a shitty trailer The Director of this movie Samuel Fuller was in the divison in WW II and was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. The Big Red One'.This movie didn't tell you what really happened when, Operation Torch, hit the beaches! what the fuck is this pussy trailer? where is the original? Did Peter Cullen narrate this? Optimus Prime! and I thought steven spielberg who created the first world war film Great film, shitty trailer That was such a awesome movie. It is a truly awful trailer, perhaps the worst I've ever seen, but the movie is worth watching. "Some say...it was the worse movie trailer voice over ever" and the were RIGHT! Go watch 'Shock Corridor' instead. when I first saw this movie when I was 10 I thought it was an awesome movie, and I thought it was so cool with all the battle scenes and I thought everything was historically correct , and now I do world war 2 reenactments as a German and I realize how bad this movie is, I put it right next to how bad the battle of the bulge movie. Peter Cullen? 1:17 - "My Cock!" Lee Marvin was far too old. Look who's the dumbass, he wasn't nagging on the movies special effects, he was mentioning the cheesy edited effects in the trailer.The movie originally came out in 1980 but the trailer here is for the 2004 restored version. This is an awful trailer for a great film.
The Black Marble Bello 	filme! My how time goes by 35 years now, good movie and a great book! ya gotta see it.  so great.  I had my first bowl of borscht after having watched this way back when. Good Russian folk music A forgotten film.
Bloodeaters 	always remember John Amplas as Martin, but his acting did get better from Toxic Zombies to Day of the Dead Honestly who came here because of Mortician? Below: "Fleshdrinkers"...somebody make that sequel happen!Love the grindhouse look of the trailer - short, succinct, dark, with screaming, a menacing narrator, and the bloody font and the  ubiquitous "rated R!" Haven't you ever hears of "Blood Pudding"? (Boudin in french)It's actually very good! LOL, that's exactly what I thought! "Coming soon.....Flesh Drinkers!!".
The Blue Lagoon 	Dying from laughter... Muscle talk, dear god... It's pretty weird when you find out they are cousins <3 wtf did i just watch It's Lord of the Flies with romance. I watched this movie and it was boring and their was so many movie mistakes tbh A few years ago I read a post in a yahoo groups Blue Lagoon group from a guy who worked on themovie set,he said that in the first love seen Christian Atkinsshot his load in his loin cloth and they had to reshoot the scene! Wow I never saw this movie and the trailer just gave away everything. Wtf. This movie is so "innocent" that it capitalized on the sexualization of a 14yo girl's image. Brooke Shield's first sensual photoshoot was at the age of 11. This is highly problematic and it's worth thinking critically about. What the heck! XD well, it was bound to happen sooner or later lol por que ella tiene el cabello sedoso y brillante? yo voy a la playa un dia y ya esta todo feo :v Omg the Tarzan family lol This trailer is racist! "Dark sinister..." totally ignorant about an indigenous culture. .....I still love this movie though. haha I feel like this is how aliens would explain humans if they had some kind of nat geo alien channel. CHEEZE The ending ticked me off I didn't like how they thought that they were gonna die because they ate the berries than the boy's father found them but they didn't show there reaction :/ when I was little and watched this I thought they were brother and sister and I was soo traumatised Watched this movie, very good acting, fuck the critics this was a very good movie dont know what they were talking about. U guys do realize they were cousins, right?
The Blues Brothers 	one of my best movies <3 "We're on a mission from god" faak eoo My mother told me that this movie left it's mark on the cinema history. Just watched this today. This was f*cking amazing!! :D P.S. Did this movie start the myth about cops driving like madmen? XD Greatest musical comedy film ever made! Always loved this movie! All-time favorite movie ever. Best Movie :) Great movie, I can watch it over and over.. btw, is that Richard Pryor at 0:52? try eating corn on the cob with no fucking teeth class I was not sure till tonight, now seeing this again tonight made it clear. This is undoubtedly one of the most stupid movies ever made. You need to be black, or retard, or wayfarer fan to like it. Or all the three together. like How is 480p HD? to hot to handle :-) not only a great film, also a musical treasure trove and delight. makes for a great backyard neighborhood movie.  So good it's crazy! its so random and great love that.

Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown 	(and Don't Come Back!!) Dariun Felix i haven't  seen bon voyage charlie brown on TV for years
The Boogey Man 	A couple days ago, I bought this movie. Has anyone seen this movie? If so, would you recommend it? srac po gaciach THE WORST MOVIE FRANCHISE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND! who's watching in 2017 UNBELIVEABLE HORSESHIT Cheeseboogey man After all the text of the beginning I wanted to shout "IT'S JOHN CENA!' Wooo dudeIcsd omg THIS IS CRAZY this was the first horror movie i watched n i was pretty young im still a teen now but i just remembered today that this was the first ever scary movie to cause me to love scary movies and its so special to me for sum reason is that weird oh well awesome movie I gonna watch this movie https://wap.boostmobile.com/ 1st boogeyman is the best, 2nd  sucked, 3rd is good "Nothing 'supernatural' happened." YEAH, RIGHT. Tell that to the Winchesters. What was the ending song in the movie oumaigode watching this in aug 31 2016 Shit its so scary to me trailer's not scary at all
Borderline 	Terrible movie. I do not like. Terrible movie. I do not like.  Cool thy  whats the name from the song at the end?
Brubaker 	haha brubaker shittle This is based on a true story Robert Redford became Mr.brubaker good movie. Quote from movie. What you think we ought to do Mr.brubaker brubaker said let me do my job Guatanomo. Based on the Thomas Murton book where he was a warden of Arkansas prison in the sixties. Prisoners were buried all around the prison. The book is much worse than what is shown in the movie including the prisoners backing up the warden. The book is worth reading too. Watched it today, great film really enjoyable. Yeah prison guards probably have enough stress and want to relax when they get home. But on the otherhand they may want to watch the film and comment on all the mistakes and mistreatment they see.
Bye Bye Brasil 	Eu queria o filme completo mas foi tirado pelos direitos autorais coloca o filme completo! ! KKKKKKKKK   SAUDADES GRANDE WILKER .JOSE SENSACIONAL  ( MADE IN BRASIL )
Caddyshack 	loved john Cena at the end I laughed just about the whole time through this trailer!!! Quite the cast for sure! Funny movie :D
Can't Stop 	the Music "Once you see it, you'll know why you......can't stop......HEAVING." you can't stop Catrina, nobody can stop Catrina. hi my name's catrina! Watch this movie and then Xanadu. You will quickly see that every background player in Can't Stop is anchored in a character, and that every scene is grounded in a reality. In Xanadu, the LEAD actors don't even believe what they are doing! Haaaaahahaha, so this explain Caitlin Jenner. This movie is rainbow unicorns dipped in glitter gay! Wait, i don't get it.Can i stop the music or not? H/T to HDTGM? I love the disco music, but the movie itself is so oddly weird & embarrassing that it makes Xanadu look like a great movie The woman at 1:29 looks like Dr. Frank-N-Furter from Rocky Horror Pictures Show! LOL. At least Steve Guttenberg's career survived enough to do Cocoon and Police Academy No.  Please.  Try stopping the music. Ok Music, Dreadful Movie... You mean, "Starring CATILYN Jenner!" This is the gayest  film I've ever seen !!!!! I don't know if there are any other film that is this campy and fabulous,  then this film  I love this movie - no lie, it may not be Oscar material but it is entertaining
Carny 	I just checked out Robbie Robertson's book today and was disappointed he told no stories about this film. After "Last Waltz" and his friendship with Scorsese, it seemed like he was being primed for a movie career. I was always curious why he did this film. I feel dirty.
Cecilia 	Now that's just scary... cool video
The Changeling 	Worst ending i have ever seen Brilliant movie. Very dark. I love watching a film that you think is going to take you in a certain direction and then leads you somewhere different. John Malkovic is superb. that how is a block away from where I live great movie its espsualy good with uce cream A great movie!!!#Heartbreaking too much spoiler for one trailer what confused me is that in the film, the replacement kid "supposedly pretended to be Walter Collins" but then tried to admit that the police made him do it towards the end. that needs an explanation. This happened in the town I grew up in for ten years called Eastvale,CA....had no idea till today Love this movie.. Its very underrated Best movie of all time Oh yeah absolutely.  Just saw it last night.  Loved it.   this movie is amazing! where can i download the Changeling Theatrical Trailer
Cheech and Chong's Next Movie 	Does anyone knows who plays that little guitar riff at the ending of the trailer? "Responsibility is a heavy responsibility!" mmmmmmmmmmmm fcking profesional trailer
The Children of An Lac 	Wonderful, heart warming ... and above all it is based on a real story. The most wonderful of all is that there are always compassionate people in the world ! the bad of this film is .... children were too young at that time to speak English and as a Vietnamese they should speak Vietnamese to Vietnamese children/people. Loved this movie,  just watched it. Came on here to see what happened to the other children,  and yours. Wish you well in all your endeavors, and thank you for sharing this story.  What ever happened to those left behind? Heartbreaking story for those left behind, but so glad at least some were able to leave. Ordinarily, I don't like to watch films like this. But because it is the story of Ina Balin -- well, I am compelled.
Children of Divorce 	I was expecting to see some "I'm an A.C.O.D." comments in this video. To my surprise and disappointment, almost every comment is about _Parks and Recreation_. This looks like one of the dumbest movies ever and I can't stand that actor with his douche face...I'd only watch this for Jane Lynch and not even that is enough of a saving grace lol crap Poehler and Scott ftw, but damn this movie is shyt slather albas butt with bbq sauce and go to town This movie was great. I found it so relatable This is so relatable. This movie is my life, and I loved Adam Scott and Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation stupid movie looks horrible awesome cast, bad movie well does ben end up with leslie? cuz i dont think i can watch this if he doesnt 1:58 God I miss Parks and Rec omg....KEVIN's mum!!! He dates his stepmom in Parks and Rec. lol Okay, I could only get through 23 seconds of this trailer before having to hit the YouTube tab.Man, way too close to the average home right now and completely stupid. Idiotic, in fact.If this is where modern American families are at, we may as well just start migrating back to the caves, because that's where this leads........................ is no one going to talk about how clark from the office is in it too NOOOOO!!!!! Ben and Leslie forever!!! The ending was... There was no ending!! Screw Hollywood. Adam and Amy were allowed to be paired up until she hit 40, now she's over the hill and he's gone down 10 years. Oh Amy...why? Just looks so weird when Adam and Amy aren't together in a show cause they are so perfect compared to Jessica and Adam  Amy Poehler and Adam Scott have too much chemistry in just one scene compared to the lack there of with him and Jessica Alba.
The Children 	I watched this when I was 7 years old. Till this day this movie haunts me. Thank you (im 13years old) God I hate the kids in this film.  Just kill them already. Democrat supporters really need to be on birth or use condoms. We would like to cut back on the criminal population. you brought them into this world:the children LOL Worst movie ever no depth to the story at all total wank! Am I the only one who found this disturbing and sickening. This movie is WANK WANK DOUBLE WANK good movie <3 anyone planning on watching this movie watch it..i liked it and i'm really hard to please when it comes to a good horror movie but this one is great just so intense throughout 7 out of 10 for me :) Stupid movie, who would make a movie about children in that negative way? I am like, the guy who made the movie is a total retart. This movie sucks balls, I wasted 1 and a half hour of my life. Not a bad movie OMG!!! This movie look so coooool!! I must to watch it!! *0* GAYYYY Ive seen the film and its crape it's not for children ,I think  I WASNT PLANNING ON GETTING CHILDREN SO ITS OKAY what what? what?
A Christmas Without Snow 	i used to have this movie on VHS years ago along with a Jimmy Swaggart campmeeting what was interesting in comparison to this movie was that the song "What a Mighty God We Serve" was led off by Thomas Sloan with a lot of singing, shouting and praising the Lord Thomas Sloan made Daisietta Kim , the soprano soloist in this movie look good by comparison! never thought id say that that someone from JSM would sing better than someone singing Handel's Messiah but that's right Thomas made Daisietta look good by comparison! i found this dvd at a good will today i cant wait to add it to my next christmas movie collecton video this year
City in Fear 	This movie was unfortunately disappointing.  I thought this was going to mysterious and spooky.  It kinda just turned into a crazy guy terrorizes 2 idiots kinda movie.  All in all, this film sucked ass, what a waste of an hour n 20 minutes.....Do yourselves a favor and skip this one, it is not the cool looking mysterious creepy vibe movie you're hoping for it to be. Alice, the girl also sang the ending theme song for the movie. Shocking, terrifying, and suprisingly thrilling. I'll give this movie an A+++. why always say best scary movie of the year. but when you watch it. the movie is just crap This flick was awesome. Reminded me of the Descent, really dug it. Check it out. Blaaah so crappy honestly  top 5 reasons why i must see this movie1.Alice Englert2.Alice Englert3.Alice Englert4.Alice Englert5.plot Looks so darn boring.. i yawned the whole movie... Looks good pause at one minute 37 seconds anyone? ! 1:37 PAUSE It is on NETFLIX mine should be here tomorrow. I want to see this one! Looks nerve racking! if you pause at 0.22 seconds you can see the sat nav on the dash board thats just rubbish did they not have a sat nav if its a modern horror ?????? looks good !!!!!!!!! its stupid how every horror movie says "one of the best horror movie of the year"
Cloud Dancer 	The into song is a really nice sounding folk piece.  Anybody know the title and artist?   In the credits and also on IMDB it shows that the part of Curtis Pitts was played by Woody Chambliss not the actual man himself. yeah, david caradine and airplanes.. must be a nice movie First of all when this movie was made they were not the Christen Eagle team, they were called the Red Devils. The members were Gene Soucy, Tom Poberenzy and Charlie Hillard, they were all members of the 1972 US Aerobatic Team that won the World Championship that year. Secondly, that is not Curtis Pitts, that is an actor but they did use his shop in Afton, Wyoming for that one scene in the movie where Brad goes to visit Curtis. Man! I saw this movie only once .I checked everywhere. I couldnt find anything and now look at the intro!. Thanks a lot ! :)) @RichSp33 look up cloud dancer movie and the second link will be it @S2bboy cool :-) where can I find it to buy? @RichSp33 We just bought a Dvd of it @compknerd Would be nice. @SaintVacuum hy the name of the song is "Like sainted angel". I known that but i didn't know the artist XD beautiful film Oh...and btw....whomever was asking about the song in the intro.  Don't know the name of the song off the top of my head, but the singer is Gene Cotton (from my hometown, incidentally).  Was recorded for the movie, don't think he released it elsewhere. The Movie Channel ran the crap out of this one (with the original English soundtrack, thankfully) back in the early '80's.  It also came out on VHS about that time.  I've not seen it on any other format since.  Would love to find it on DVD...doubt that exists, though.  Guess I'll have to be happy with my bootleg VHS copy...it's the only reason I still have a VCR. Got this small part from the VHS tape. I am searching for a DVD a long time... w/o success :-( Been looking for this movie on cd for a long time
The Club 	acabo de verla y es muy buena Great movie. The score was beautiful and haunting. what s the movie about? How to be a Roman Catholic:1. Throw Jews down the well2. Throw feminists on bonfires3. Be sexually abused by a pedophile priest4. Believe in fictional characters5. Hate Protestants6. Believe in priest-contrived miracles.7. Believe that the Roman Church is the only true church8. Worship the Pope Just watched this.... Im shaking still from the first scene.....makes one really question Forgiveness and its Meaning https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/14551692/Th.[El.Club].2015.1080p.BRRip.x264.AC3.HORiZON-ArtSubs Christianity is one fucked up religion being hermit is pure evil. Whaddap i got a big cock I don't get it, the guys at the beach won't beat some guy for money but they beat the priest. They say they're not thugs, maybe some stupid a-holes. That bearded priest is quite attractive. Sorry... Favorite reductio ad absurdum:"If there were no more poor people, there would be no more saints and that would be a terrible thing." baddddddddddddddd all christians should watch this... Ugh! This looks like an excellent movie, but I can't read and enjoy (watch) the acting at the same time. Boring as hell This is really great...though I didn't quite understand how the sex scene between the molested guy and the woman contributed to the story.  =) Seriously another bullshit video , Strong dumb experience.and someone write no filters about child abuse and sins hahaha. I saw it yesterday. Brutal. Dark. Terrible. Incredible actors. Strong experience awesome performance of all actors, filmed with real ligth, no filters about child abuse and sins
Coach of the Year 	I  Love you Chris brown  your. cute.  and. funny on. the movie and crazy. and your always  fighting on  the movie Wooooooow Never seen it but will see it just for caty lotz! i pressed dislike but once i reached min 1:45 i removed my dislike and replaced it with like :) nao tem esse filme completo ainda nao galera ? what is your song ? song ? chris brown Oh cool d trix gets to be in a movie i hope ryan higa gets to be in a movie too i hope the whole RHPC gets to be in a movie that will be cool I watched just to see Chris brown  1:37Dose anyone know the name on that footwork? I love this movie but second sucks Is tnis out now......january 2015 As soon as I found out josh peck was in it I was like am going to watch that SAWYER!
Coal Miner's Daughter 	I love this movie so much!  The acting is absolutely superb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Never gets old and always is better and better everytime I watch it!  I also love that Sissy Spacek and Beverly D'Angelo did their own singing.  I know that there are others who did their own singing in other movies and such.  But the talent that Sissy and Beverly had in this movie really made it authentic.  Tommy Lee Jones and Levon Helm pulled off the role of Mooney and Ted Webb quite sufficiently.  One of my absolute favorites and a REAL treat to watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Coal miners daughter Perhaps the Greatest Movie Biopic of all time. Perfect casting, perfect music, everything is just perfection!! None of the other nominees stood a chance that year for the Academy Award against Sissy. She won every award prior to the Oscar and it was well deserved. I saw the movie in the theaters at least 13 times when it was released. The movie should have won the Oscar for Best Picture that year as well! ..I saw this movie with both my parents when it came out.. I'm pretty sure it's the only movie I ever saw with both of them at the same time at the theater.. even though they were married over 40 years Tommy Lee Jones is HOT! does any one know the name of the baby in Loretta Lynn movie, the child would be mother baby at the time Hands down, my favorite performance by any actor/actress is Sissy Spacek in this. Unreal how good she is. Like her accent in this. This is (in my opinion) is Sissy Spacek's second best role along with Carrie. At age 15, Lynn married 21-year old Oliver Vanetta Lynn, known variously as "Doolittle," "Doo" or "Mooney", on January 10, 1948. damn she was almost an old maid by southern standers at that age back then ! Levon Helm. Legend. I love it tommy is sexy with a blonde haircut or a dark haircut tommy lee Jones is so sexy in a cowboy hat Growing up dirt poor, I mean real dirt poor in East Texas.  We, my family caught this movie outside a drive in. My Daddy some how with a radio antenna caught reception, we allsat down to watch a classic. I was just 8, with broken shoes, and thought to myself, wow poor people can survive and make it. This is essentially the movie. You've seen it now. Love this movie
Coast to Coast 	What an awesome soundtrack !<3 hi wait uncoming fot ps3 ?? can i Play with a friend of me who has an ps4 but i have an xbox one wow they're driving so fast jk That was slightly depressing somehow all this game is mission is more cars more like the solocant form any crew I like the music Gotta love having a street spec Indian Scout.

The Courage of Kavik, the Wolf Dog 	I read the book in class LOLl Poor man is dead no trauma to the child---it is a nice movie for family--the wringer really surprised me because that is really from the past i have this on a dvd i bought from the dollar store years ago.   features john candy. The time period this story was to take place evidently was the 1950S or early 1960S. The dial phone and the Maytag washing machine and the cars would put it in that time period. So this story takes place in Alaska produced for family viewing and young audience very common for that time period. Kavik's acting was superb he was a delight to watch. Must be one of those German malmutes ..... very nice movie----kavic is a really a brave dog very nice movie .. i do enjoyed watching .. love it a lot .. thumbs up A Malamute? Uh...dummy, thats a German shepherd. i love this movie One of my favorite childhood books, I fell in love with Alaska as a result.
Cruising 	fuck gays...never watched this movie This trailer is ruined by the modern voice over bs. And the overly dramatic film. Watch the original trailer. Looks awful! bad moms? huh Shitty movie and a an even shittier soundtrack. If they used disco music, it would have been more authentic but they used some shitty ass rock music. MAN I want 2 see this movie.  Any1 know where i can get it? I fucking love being a sodomite. We have the best night life as shown here in this film. You can see Al is gradually turning gay as he gets more involved in the gay scene; this is because all men have the bi gene and are naturally attracted to each other, and most will make love to another man, but just won't admit it. Being 100% is total freedom, as hanging out in these awesome clubs is a turn on sucking on a cock while all the other patrons watches. Or hanging out in the park at night cottaging is awesome, as also shown in the film - but the best is hanging around public toilets and making glory holes in the cubicles to fuck a strangers asshole ir suck on a cock, and vice versa -- awesome. So who killed Ted at the end his boyfriend or steve???????????????????????????? a gay masterpiece. Great Movie, one of the best performances of Al Pacino, and of course, great directing! . i agree with Pacino. it was just a horrible film with an even worse ending. Supposedly black women getting HIV has a lot to do with closeted black men fucking other men and then going home and fucking them.  Straight males are probably the least likely to catch it.   "HIV are WAY LOWER if you're heterosexual."Bullshit, you go tell that to some "heterosexual" black women, who are contracting HIV at an alarming rate. Al Pacino is a thespian extraordinaire...his name garners respect along with some of Hollywood's elite, i.e. Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant and Marlon Brando to name a few. Epic roles in films such as Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Devils Advocate and Godfather I, II, III. His credentials are impeccable. This looks promising indeed.  Here's a shocking thought...If you want to reduce your chance of getting aids DON'T SCREW EVERYTHING WITH A PULSE!  Its not rocket science, dumbass. Schlesinger, who, like Finch's character, was both homosexual and Jewish, was criticized in some gay-lib precincts for the seediness of the homosexual content in "Midnight Cowboy," specifically the scene in which Jon Voight's hustler is serviced in a dark movie theater by the student played by Bob Balaban, and another in which Voight bashes a middle-aged suitor in a sexual encounter gone wrong."  -- Peter Rainer, Bloomberg News

They shall be known as the Warriors of the Rainbow. Hopi Prophecy The "Like" button always confuses me on videos such as these. Do you click "like" in support of the video and spreading the word... or "dislike" due to passionately hating what is actually happening to the animals in the video??? So, I just skip it altogether. :/ This video is almost like a film short. Is there a 1 -2 minute trailer? Beautiful. Perfectly done . So, so good! About an awful subject.  How do i share this heart wrenching video on Google + i already put it on FB. So does the US Canada is very like China in the number and prolonged torture of animals eventually slaughtered. Canada butchers alive 400 horses per day, tortures horses on thousands of Preg t Mare Urine farms to make Premarin/estrogen---and discards all the babies to slaughter, has the seal hunt, supports massive trophy hunting of bears, has slaughtered all but 200 of its wild mustangs, has a huge fur trapping trade, and has the largest puppy mill density in North America next to PA (Quebec).
Death Car 	on the Freeway One of my favorite TV movies!
Defiance Zus 	is a fucking badass lol this was made before fury, and tbh this film beats fury, such better story line Low budget Fury I heard there is a new polish drama on tv-I switched on the tv only to see this, thinking 'the main guy looks like Daniel Craig' and 'bad acting-he keeps switching to a half Scottish accent' ...lol Fucking jews lies. I watched that movie and it was great @Jaime DP shut up bitch pg comments ZUS MY MAN! It's a WWII movie don't get too attached to the characters I didn't know so many Germans spoke English during WWII Why the fuck is Lara Croft talking in the beginning of the video? Saving private ryan is better tban this movie so now I'm 50/50 on this film, as a whole it wasn't bad but it REALLY dragged on for me. which was a shame because I wonted to love this film. I still own it and maybe it will improve on a re-watch but still it's not aweful.
The Kingfisher Caper 	the trailer doesn't do it justice...this movie will make you cry. best romantic comedy I've ever seen Its mental Wow this trailer is the exact opposite of the movie's tone! One of the top 5 all time movies. such a great cast....whatever happened to Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer? One of the best movies! I don't think they spent enough time studying what homeless life was/is really like. To walk through those doors hand in hand, side by side, is the dream. I didn't even know I could dream that big. Until there was you. Until there was you. Over all terrible movie... with some interesting parts.  RIP Robin. perfect movie, the best ever!! The trailer doesn't do this justice. Amazingly good movie. Damn! Forgot all about this gem, think I'll get a copy from Amazon. Incredible movie.
Die Laughing 	think I was the only one to see this movie at theater when it came out. as a kid this was a great movie. as an adult it funny because Robbie Benson took the role so serious. him calling the monkey is funny and bud court is insanely comic genius Thanks man, been looking for this trailer forever, used to be on youtube a shitlong time ago. Never seen this movie but damn is the trailer something.
The Dogs of War 	I snuck into a theater in the seventies to see this movie.  This movie still rules ! Wait.  What happened to Walken's accent?  He talks like a normal person in this movie! Hahaha... that "super weapon," is hilarious. Oh the 80s, thanks for all the cheese. Watched this today. It was terrible. I saw this in the theater. So after 4 years nobody noticed the mac 10 that was supped up to be an UZI in the pic and in 1:30? ..................................................shared........................................!!! My God, trailers were awful back in the 70's. Fortunately this film is infinitely better than this mess portrays. filmed only in BELIZE Good movie, but nothing beats the novel. olu Jacobs..... :) naija.. This is a joke ?
Don't Answer the Phone! Cosby? 	In my opinion, the only scene(s) that was or were "unnecessary," was the scene where the psychiatrist is "helping" her patient overcome her drug addict via "hypnotism:" "Mom, dad, the drugs are better than you!" Over and over again!  Well, that's true, it isn't really gory at all. I just got bored watching some sexual predator go around killing women. I like my slasher films with some gore. This movie was so boring. If you enjoy sleaze and cheesy synth music, you'll love it. This movie was so damn shitty lol.
